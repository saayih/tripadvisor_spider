Indian Room,"I‚Äôve been here twice now in the past week. Both times I‚Äôve been welcomed with exceptional service and loved my food and drinks. Would highly recommend!
The waiter, Nur, was one of warmest waiters I‚Äôve ever been served by. Thank you!

"
Vine Bar London,"I read the reviews oft his little place and decided, since it was close-ish to my hotel, to check it out. It's a quaint and cozy little wine bar with an authentic Italian atmosphere. You feel like you're walking into someone's home (in a good...way). The staff was incredibly friendly and took great care of me - and the food was top notch (I've been to Italy several times so feel I can make a fair comparison). I had the bread and olive oil with balsamic, the gnocci white (gorgonzola and mushrooms), and the most delicious panna cotta with a subtle basil flavor, plus a glass of Pinot Grigio. Mike, the manager, was really friendly and I promptly came back to my hotel to write this review. I'll definitely visit the Vine Bar again on my next trip to London and I highly recommend you enjoy it on your visit as well. I do recommend making reservations.
"
Vine Bar London,"Went to meet old friends we hadn‚Äôt see in a long while. This was the perfect venue. Small and intimate with incredibly caring staff we were made to feel immediately at home. The food was lovely and it was nice to meet the cook and...compliment her and her companion in the kitchen in person. The sommelier really knows his stuff and takes the time to think about how the wine will enhance menu choices. The waitress always made sure we were catered for and her approach definitely helped the evening flow. We never had to catch her eye as she was there anticipating our needs. The icing on the cake was the beautiful live music which I believe is on every Thursday to Saturday. It‚Äôs a lovely setting, a little bit of Italy in heart of Nine Elms.
"
Vine Bar London,"Found and booked this based on reviews on TA and luckily managed to get in last minute for Saturday evening 

Pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find a small, personal little restaurant. Sat outside and chose our dishes from the small but very authentic menu...All the items were explained well by the owner Roberto who took the time throughout the 3hrs we spent there checking with us to see how things were and chatting about the food, wine, history of the dishes etc. 

Well cooked and well presented, good Italian wines to choose from and we had a really lovely evening. Our advice to him is to seriously consider opening one in Jersey as it would be very popular using the same formula. 

Thank you once again. We will be back when over in London for sure 

Oh and please; if you expect pizzas then go to pizza express!

Vine Bar London,"My friend and I were just wanting a quick bite, we weren‚Äôt dressed for anything fancy and we came across this little gem. So pleased we found it. We felt like family on entering and we loved that every single staff member came over and...introduced themselves. We really felt like part of the team. They walked us through the full menu and when the food arrived they also told us where it came from. This place went above and beyond my expectations. If I wasn‚Äôt from Newcastle, id be here every day. A very friendly, warm atmosphere. You NEED to visit ‚ù§Ô∏è
"
Vine Bar London,"If you‚Äôre looking for a happy day,happy people and a happy eating without leaving London, check out this  authentic Italian food in London, as chosen by an Italian ‚Äì you can‚Äôt get much more authentic than that- the best Italian restaurant in London. 
Buon appetito!...‚ÄòVine Bar London‚Äô
I came in on a sad gloomy unhappy day hungry and tired and Viola! It was like magic my mood changed 360 degrees in minutes! Hidden behind the busy streets, next to the beautiful Saint Georges wharf,stepping into here felt like stepping back into to a bygone era of Italian glamour, vanilla candles melted on small wooden  tables, pop art fusion furnishings, low lighting and charming servers. I met ‚ÄúIrena‚Äù my beautiful server, and u see her doing absolute justice to her job. Shes absolute love! The ambience is lovely makes u go to the streets of italy!  While the staff makes u feel alive happy,It‚Äôs elegant without being ostentatious, and the wooden stools comforting small tables low glass window booths add an important touch of cosiness. The glamorous central bar is irresistible for a classic Italian meal.  I suggest before the mains start with generous shavings of black truffle and surprisingly good burrata bites served on a bed of radicchio with balsamic vinegar. Have the Della mamma the freshly made gnocchi, or the Pesce all‚Äôacqua pazza, with a side of the fresh creamy burrata served with truffle bruschetta and spiced olives! Foodgasm!!! 
Customised meals made fresh on-site in an open kitchen ( you may see them dancing and singing while preparing your meal making you light laugh and lively) it‚Äôs impossible to resist in its various incarnations on the menu. The highlight is the pesto gnocchi and the house made ravioli. You‚Äôll find some more unusual pasta dishes on the menu too which are well worth a gander ‚Äì its  a real run for your money. A very special restaurant ‚Äì it gets 5* from me. Saint George Wharf. London SW8 

TRY: Whatever Roberto recommends ‚Äì he really does know best! Heard Italians give justice to three things hospitality love and food and the ‚Äòvine bar‚Äô is an all in one experience! What a delight. Enjoy your journey to the little italy and give your tastebuds the ultimate experience!
"
Vine Bar London,"This place has become my absolute favourite! The hospitable staff always go above and beyond to make it the best dining experience and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority.

The restaurant is cute and charming, as are the staff.

"
Vine Bar London,"I booked a table for my teenage daughter and her three friends.  They had difficult finding it and were scolded by the staff for being late despite calls to notify them.  To begin with they had difficulty being allowed in as the staff didn't believe...they were 17 and told one girl she looked 12.  They were angry as they seemed to assume the girls were going to try and buy alcohol which wasn't their intention!  I told them when I booked it that it was for my daughter so that might have been a good time to tell me there was a minimum age limit.  Two of the girls wanted to pay with cash but were told they 'don't do change' so ended up having to pay more than their share of the bill.  This was not deducted from the others so between them they paid ¬£70 instead of ¬£53.  That's one hell of a service charge!  The fact that they enjoyed their carbonara hardly seems worth mentioning.  After all that the staff even asked the girls to give them a review on trip advisor!  These girls are polite, well-intentioned and NOT entitled - I don't know why they were so badly treated.
"
Vine Bar London,"My partner and I had a meal here on a Saturday evening. The place looks so unassuming from the outside but  is very nice inside. The best thing about the place is the service, Irena our waitress was simple amazing. Irena was friendly and extremely...knowledgable about the menu and wine options available. We started with some grilled vegetables and some anchovies, all very tasty. My partner then had the Sherwood, ravioli with truffles. I had an excellent pasta Norma, in fact one of the better ones I have had. The last courses are large and after the starters and pasta we were simply too full to have dessert. We will certainly go again as it typifies what an excellent neighbourhood Italian restaurant should be.
"
Vine Bar London,"Went out for lunch with a friend in Vauxhall after my visa appointment and this place did not disappoint. The service was lovely, Irene looks after you and makes diligent suggestions (including alcohol based on the temperature that time of the day). Equally, her outfit...was entirely from charity shops so bonus point for sustainability, as well as recommending me a new charity shop near to Clapham junction. The other staff were incredibly friendly too and asked how we were in a non-invasive manner. Honestly their service makes up for the location being next to a busy road and not the river. The food was also excellent and I highly recommend their gnocchis if you are looking for a nice light lunch. Overall, a fantastic little find and well worth the praise, just going off of the service alone!
"
Vine Bar London,"Was honestly blown away by the hospitality of the staff and the quality of the food. We were welcomed on arrival by the wonderful team and they even gave us free limoncello to celebrate another guests birthday. Would visit again.

Tower Tandoori,"We visited the restaurant this evening. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The Service  was excellent and the food was amazing. The chicken Tikka was succulent an the Lamb shank just fell away from the bone. 

They are currently offering a limited dine in...menu but we‚Äôre keen to point out the chef would prepare you something off the take away menu if you wanted.  Unfortunately the people on the table next to us thought this meant you could eat in but only pay the take away menu prices!  When it was explained they had only been given that menu to help them choose items that weren‚Äôt on the dine in menu, they became very rude and said they wanted to eat in but pay the price on the take away menu.  The manager dealt with the situation very professionally but it a shame they had to justify charging a different price for dining in when the hospitality industry is desperately trying to recover from the loss of revenue due to the pandemic.

Tower Tandoori,"We walked here from Tower Bridge on recommendation of Oakham Curry Club member; glad we did. It was very early evening so there were lots of waiters on hand and only a few diners, so clearly the service was sharp and attentive.

We had Smokey lamb chops as a starter followed by Dahaba Gohst, Chicken Tikka jalfrezi with black lentils and spinach paneer rice and naan.  Great flavours and a decent quantity of food too. With a bottle of wine and service it came to about ¬£86 for us both. We also appreciated the fact that the menu, as displayed on their web site was compact.

So why have I not awarded this restaurant the coveted 5 stars. 1) I would have preferred a beer with my meal ( though the red wine was fine) but there was only cobra or kingfisher on offer and 2) the initial feeling of the interior was a bit underwhelming. The toilets were super modern and clean.
"
Tower Tandoori,"The food was absolutely amazing. Not once during our visit did the staff steer us wrong. If it wasn‚Äôt on the menu, we were encouraged to ask because the chefs would do what they could. Dipok, sorry is misspelled, was an absolutely gem. He answered...everyone of my questions and offered the most delicious suggestions. We had such a great time that in our three day visit, we will be going back.
"
Tower Tandoori,"Highly recommend this restaurant. Exceptional food and lovely welcoming atmosphere. 
Although the menu appears quite limited they are happy to cook anything you ask for. The staff are friendly and attentive without being over the top.
The food was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented....The chef is obviously passionate about what he does and it shows. This is quite possibly my favourite Indian restaurant.
"
Tower Tandoori,"I dont often write reviews but felt I should. At the Tower Tandoori we had a flavoursome ,delicious meal, with a friendly comfortable atmosphere and service. 
With a reduced menu due to covid they would also cook a dish that you requested.  
Will be going...back.
"
Tower Tandoori,"Having waited for 1.30 minutes for my takeway....the food that arrived was appalling...not one dish even looked or tasted as is should. 

The whole order had been cobbled together by someone who had no experience or care in what they were doing! 

Truly awful food!...Avoid.
"
Tower Tandoori,"Probably the 2nd best Indian restaurant I have ever been to. Limited menu, but when you sit down the waiter says if you want something that's not on the menu they will make  it for you if they can.
  The flavours in the food are...amazing, even in the hot dishes the heat doesn't over power the taste. 
  The staff are very friendly  and helpful, providing a great service üëç. 
  Went here with my wife and 2 kids 10 and 12 year old.
Our bill was just over ¬£100 for 2 courses and drinks. 
  Well worth a visit, I will definitely visit again when I'm in London. 
    Keep up the good work guys.
"
Tower Tandoori,"We came across this curry house while staying in elephant and castle. I have 3 really fussy eaters who love curry (but no bits in the sauce as they would say üôÑ) The guys were great, very helpful and understanding. The food was amazing, probably...one of the best curries we have had in the UK. Wish we lived closer. Will definitely be back if in the area again. Thank you Tower Tandori.
"
Tower Tandoori,"Fantastic Indian cuisine. Me and my Japanese wife thoroughly enjoyed it.  We didn‚Äôt want too spicy and the owner was extremely helpful and friendly!  Perfect recommendations. What was most impressive is the owner recommended other restaurants to include a Japanese one. We will definitely visit...again and highly encourage you to try.
"
Tower Tandoori,"My friend and I had a lovely meal at tower tandoori - one of our locals! We couldn‚Äôt fault it, the food was delicious especially the dupiaza paneer. The servers were super attentive and accommodating to my friends vegan dietary requirements. We will be back!
"
Tower Tandoori,"Not been here for a while, was lovely to see a great new layout with more open space, refreshing refurbishment and the new menu tantalising. The chicken hit the spot with the right temperature on the tongue won't be forgetting that curry in a hurry....Rumon and his staff members super friendly as always creating the right ambience everytine, not forgetting to mention the play list and a certain twist to the update too. If you like free upgrades check this place out.

Tower Tandoori,"Best Indian food I‚Äôve had!!  We were a hungry group of 7 .. came in late at night.

Tower Tandoori,"A lovely tandoori Indian restaurant in London Bridge and Bermondsey area, serving brilliant quality Indian takeaway for the meantime.

"
Tower Tandoori,"Just as many others before us, we also enjoyed our dinner at Tower Tandoori.   We had a variety of dishes.  My husband had Lamb Vindaloo that was not on the menu, the kids obligatory chicken tikka masala and I had small portions of Dahl and...spinach paneer.   All dishes were very very tasty.  I especially enjoyed Nan bread and lamb chops appetizer.  The prices were moderate.  Be aware that unlike in  US restaurants, some dishes may not come w rice.  The service was very kind and attentive without being annoying.   The restaurant was very clean, and modern, including the bathroom.  Finally, It was really good to get away from the crowds of touristy places and enjoy dinner amongst the locals.   I am really happy we saw this restaurant in our walk to the Tower  Bridge.

Thank you again Rinku and team :)
"
Indian Room,"The staff were incredibly friendly and professional. The dark mint sauce that came with the poppadoms,  the vegetarian plater, and the paneer saag channa main were delicious. The paneer makhani curry was incredibly sweet and I had to send it back. They made a complimentary...one which was spicy but still sweet. I think the menu or staff should say this is meant to taste sweet. They also gave me a complimentary naan which was nice of them. The naans are over priced at ¬£3.50 each. I'd go again though.
"
Indian Room,"I‚Äôve been to the restaurant and was so happy with the food that during lockdown  we‚Äôve ordered a few times from here. 
The food here is the best Indian food I‚Äôve ever had and I‚Äôve recommended this restaurant to everyone that is from London and...can‚Äôt wait to take my friends from here when lockdown is over. 
The food is fab but the service is even better, it‚Äôs a lovely place to go too. They  are even lovely if you have to call up on a busy Saturday night because you forgot something. 
If you are ordering an Indian in the south of London I would 100% suggest this place and I‚Äôm a northerner so even it seems slightly pricey it‚Äôs so worth it!
"
Indian Room,"For years we have used this restaurant for takeaways and after a recommendation we booked to eat in. 
The food was absolutely delicious but unfortunately the restaurant was packed out and seemed overbooked so from the minute we arrived we felt rushed. We had no...starters , delicious main courses and then we weren‚Äôt even offered the option to have desserts, we were told that people were waiting outside for our table and so the waiter gave us our bill. We then waited for someone to come and take payment and instead had another waiter come and tell us that people were waiting for our table and we had to leave.  It was really disappointing. 
Even though the manager apologised and gave us a bottle of wine, we would have preferred a better dining experience. The table next to us had exactly the same complaint.
It‚Äôs a real shame, their food is amazing but I think they need to carefully consider the amount of bookings they can cope with.
"
Indian Room,"From the moment we walked into the Indian room, the service was appalling that I actually said to my husband that we should leave. The tone from the staff was abrupt rude and rushed. We ordered wine when we sat down that they forgot to...bring until halfway through our meal which we then said we did not want. The waiters were constantly watching over us cleaning the table as we ate leaning over our food, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they were busy but we were the only diners in there now I know why. The food was was bland not the best curry I have eat and also served in chipped dishes see pic which is shocking. To top it off we wanted to pay by cash to be told they only accept card and kept asking if we had a card to use So we said we only had cash  and walked out never again will I be visiting the Indian room. Totally unacceptable service which let me annoyed

"
Indian Room,"Indian Room holds a special place in my heart.
Moving from the states to the UK resulted in losing
home cooked meals but every time I come here I feel
like I'm part of the family. In fact the minute I sat down
and ordered...the Biryani the staff remembered that I
loved pickled mango (Kerala roots!) and had it ready
to dispense without even asking.

What's even more impressive is that the staff
remember where I sat the last time and what I
ordered. How about that for attention to detail?!
Further The management and staff make it a point to
make every visit a memorable one. It's rare outside of
the Michelin Star world to receive such service. Whilst
the service is phenomenal what's even better is the
food. I typically order the Thali platter (alternate
between veg and non) and you'll never be
disappointed with either. Again highly recommend
Indian Room and hope you take the effort to find it
and enjoy it as much as I have. They truly make you
feel like you're part of the family and ensure you leave
satisfied and not hungry!

KR,
Alex

The staff were incredibly warm, attentive, and went above and beyond to make the experience feel warm, joyful and familial. We will definitely be returning!
"
Indian Room,"I normally like going here but today was the worst service I‚Äôve had in any restaurant, this place is really going downhill. All this place clearly cares about is making money - just take a look at how over capacity they are every night, it‚Äôs...completely uncomfortable to eat your meal. This surely goes against some kind of standards, I should not in a restaurant this expensive have to stand up whilst eating to let people out of the corner they have squeezed them into and have my chair hit every time someone walks past... this is not ok. 

Even the waiters aren‚Äôt as polite as they used to be, aggressively putting food down on the table. They used to be so attentive but now they just want you in, take your money and out as quickly as possible. 

What‚Äôs worse is this also reflects on the food they are serving - poor, bland and overpriced. 

Never coming here again.

Cafe de Provence,"I visited Cafe de Provence for breakfast during my recent stay at Covent Garden. Impressive reviews for this place kept it under my radar for some time, so I didn't waste first opportunity when I was in the area.

I ordered English Breakfast with Coffee...and Orange Juice. The staff of this Cafe was adequately attentive but they had some refrigerator problem that day, so all of them were distracted and focused elsewhere. This hinders my review to give an honest opinion about their service,

As for the breakfast, it was really good and everything was so fresh. Not the best breakfast in London but definitely worth a shot.

The highlight of this cafe is value for money. Therefore, a lot of locals hang around in addition to tourists. For such fresh food in Covent Garden area, you can't get anything at even double the price elsewhere in central London. Overall, a small but good cafe that's easy on the pocket.
"
Cafe de Provence,"Did not fancy the run of the mill Travelodge breakfast so opted for Cafe de Provence which is located at the bottom of the hotel entrance. So glad we did as the food was lovely, so we came back the following day. The generous portions...fueled us for our 20,000 steps around London with no need for lunch. The eggs royale was so nice I had to have the same again the following day! Great service and an ideal venue to have up your sleeve whenever in the West End..... merci
"
Cafe de Provence,"What a delightful discovery this Aladdin‚Äôs Cave of caf√©s is. London seems to have lost too many of this intimate proper caf√©s where great food, great service & great atmosphere far outrank the homogenised mega coffee chains or the toffee nosed posh eateries where the...more you pay the less you get. A excellent selection from the hot buffet with chicken, saffron rice, roasted potatoes and tender carrots as well as some gorgeous apple & walnut salad. All this served up by some of friendliest staff I have met for many a year. First visit but 100% certain this will not be my last.
"
Cafe de Provence,"That morning I was checking out from Travelodge hotel. It was very cold to be August, super windy, I had a look at the menu outside their shop. Shop curtain was disgustingly dirty. I didn't want English breakfast because I wanted to have lunch after...an hour so couldn't fill my stomach too much, neither I wanted hot drinks to avoid the need of using the toilet. A lady came outside and convinced me to buy food there. English breakfast was 7¬£ With sausages, bacon, eggs, tomato, mushroom, beans and toast.  I asked if was possible to have just the toast of the entire english breakfast, with a spoon of jam, of course she said yes xD.
She asked me if I wanted a smoothie as I didn't want coffee,I said yes, asking for one with banana inside, otherwise, it would be too watery. I had a banana apple blackcurrant (Price written outside was 3.90¬£). 
When breakfast arrived I wanted to cry. I received a meager toast, not even hot..maybe toasted 7 seconds. Then the terrifying part: the smoothie!
I imagined fruit mixed with milk or only fruit.. instead it was a giant glass full of crushed ice with fruit (but didn't taste of fruit, only frozen water). I wanted something fast instead I had to wait 30 minute to drink 50% of that thing... it was horrible and froze my esophagus hurting for a short but intense time. Why, why, why add 90% of ice to make it look bigger? Makes so sense. It was already so cold and windy and I was sitting outside alone and just wanted something quick. I paid 7.90¬£ for a glass of ice and a toast not toasted. 4¬£ for bread ahaha, worst breakfast in my life.  My fault I didn't ask the price before, they just take advance of unaware tourists. In 30 minutes nobody came out to ask me if everything was ok or I wanted something else.. I wish I walked away leaving that ice there.
"
Cafe de Provence,"Met by friendly staff. And seated at the side of another couple.  While we ordered the next tables food arrived. And the lady advised the toast had butter. When she'd requested it butter free. The toast was removed from her plate and placed on the...side. We could see the food being prepped and watch the toast be warmed up in the microwave and added to our plates. Such a disappointment as other then this the food was lovely.  We of course requested a fresh piece. And they did replace it. But with hygiene it was very off putting.
"
Cafe de Provence,"We were searching for a place for breakfast near Covent Garden that would please adults and fussy children and this was great. It made me think that if I was more local or worked nearby I‚Äôd eat there a lot more. 
I had the full...English which was good, my wife had the loaded bagel with smoked salmon and poached eggs which was to die for. The kids were happy with croissants and pain au chocolat. Freshly squeezed juices and coffee and all for ¬£35 or so. 
We arrived and the staff asked a couple to move so we could put two tables together and could not have looked after us better. Room for only 10 inside and about 6 outside this place clearly does a roaring takeaway business.
A slightly pretentious name for a totally unpretentious place.
"
Cafe de Provence,"Incredibly friendly staff, very welcoming, helpful and they serve delicious food. Going out of their way to make us a pre theatre snack as we were looking for a light meal when we were on the way back to our hotel (the caf√© staff were...all set to close, however stayed on and asked what we needed). This is superb customer focus. They prepared two delicious tuna salad baguettes, first asking what we specifically enjoy on the salad. Being so impressed with the service and especially the food, we then had a cooked breakfast the following morning, it was a 10/10. The coffee was probably one of the best ever, the cooked breakfast was amazing and plenty of it! Highly recommend Caf√© de Provence, we will certainly return.

Cafe de Provence,"My son and I stayed at Covent Garden Travelodge. This little cafe is directly below the steps leading to the hotel. What a find! The food, the service, the prices are outstanding. We had belly-busting breakfasts over 2 days with tea/coffee and never paid more...than ¬£7 a head. This is truly exceptional value in central London. The gentleman behind the counter was so nice. I cannot praise him enough for his kindness and generosity. In a big city, this little cafe is a diamond and a real  find. If I lived in London, I'd come back for breakfast every weekend. You must visit to see for yourself if staying nearby
"
Cafe de Provence,"My Mum has been working away in London since last week, staying round the corner from this venue and eating there regularly.  She loves the food and raves to me every day about how delicious everything is and such good value.  

They stepped it up...a notch yesterday however.  She arrived late, tired and a bit broken, and they had already closed.  She had been working, surveying another restaurant, but hadn't eaten there because she wanted to eat at Cafe de Provence again. Obviously she was a bit gutted.  She actually walked away then went back to check opening times before walking away again.

Amazingly, the chap working (I think the owner but not sure), saw her outside and recognised her, went out to stop her leaving and invited her in and fed her beautiful food.  She asked him to just surprise her and he produced some gorgeous aubergine dish, great coffee and biscuits that reminded her of her Italian grandparents.  He even gave her his card so she could let him know if she was going to be late back again.  She was so delighted and grateful.  

What wonderful service, hospitality and kindness.  Thankyou kind sir for looking after my Mum.  What a gent.  I will definitely make it a point to visit next time I'm down from Yorkshire.
"
Cafe de Provence,"What a gem of a place.  Visiting London with family and found this fabulous little place next door to where we were staying.

"
Cafe de Provence,"I spent a weekend with friends in London and finding a good-cheap place for breakfast in Covent garden is a bit difficult.
I found that amazing place, it is a small business. The owner was really kind and made us feel really welcome, suggested us...different options in the menu. The breakfast was amazing, good quality products homemade with a really good price. I really love that they have Moroccon mind tea.
I would love to go back anytime soon.
"
Cafe de Provence,"Just outside the mass produced breakfast experience of Travel Lodge Drury Lane is this delightful Mediterranean style cafe. We sat outside in the mild February sun and had proper fresh orange juice, delicious almond croissants and the best coffee! Friendly engaging staff, the kitchen buzzing...and a delicious display cabinet. My daughter and I are in hospitality and this is a top place!
"
Cafe de Provence,"As we had been let down by the appalling breakfast experience at Travelodge Covent Garden during our couple of days in London we decided that on our departing day we would find somewhere to eat out for breakfast before catching the tube to Euston station....Having looked on line and found this to be a literal stones throw away from the Travelodge, and with good reviews we decided to go. We weren‚Äôt disappointed. Really friendly, quick and reasonable prices, we were lucky with our timing to catch a few tables spare but it was clearly popular as it filled up quickly, and people were queuing / waiting for tables after we had sat down. Three of us had a full cooked breakfast but my son had the eggs royale. There was lots of choice if you wanted something different however and /or vegetarian as I also looked at the fruit and yogurt, but chose the full. My husband asked if our hour time slot we had would be ok and they said it was fine. We were indeed served within a short length of time and enough time to catch our train. Would definitely visit again.
"
Cafe de Provence,"I'd been craving something with some heart soul whilst wandering around the west end's usual collection of restaurant chains and tourist traps and I found this utter gem. The food looked so incredibly fresh and made with passion by people genuinely taking care that I...wanted to eat ten plates of the buffet! The selections were varied and generously made with vegetables and chicken; no using cheap fillers. The warm squash and pepper salad was amazing as was the Greek and Caesar salads. Roast chicken thighs flavoured with lemon and garlic, potato salad to die for. And I ordered one of the fluffiest omelettes I've ever eaten. I'll go back to London just to try everything on their menu. Really really lovely staff. One happy customer was I.

The Hampshire,"The Hampshire is one of the best authentic Indian cuisine restaurant I have visited In my past 4 years stay in London, they have a policy of no use of artificial colour and preservatives which I personally support, I was privileged to tour around the...entire facility including their kitchen, and must say to my best knowledge it‚Äôs has been hygienically managed. 

The space is well spread out with garden area, heating systems, Open grill service counters and to add on shisha bar. I like the ambiance especially the Bar, with a wide spread and drinks be it cocktails and mock tails. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant shisha Bar and the ambiance is truly amazing, specially given the No timing restrictions to clear the table during business hours, as their primary focus seems to be around ‚ÄúCustomer Experience‚Äù be it family, friends, corporate or any events, seems to best fit at this venue, not to forget the company of Srini and Megha who manages this place. Being down to earth individuals who helped customise our menus #Omelet #Paneer tikka, panner chilli #GulabJamoon with ice cream #MasalaPapad, #OnionSalad everyone tasted so good. all the very best for many more years of a grand success, keep up the fabulous work, I am always here to keep repeating my visits and promoting such lovely service and mouth watering food.

The Hampshire,"Since my first visit to The Hampshire in April 2021 it has become one of my favourite places in London and my top 1 place for Indian food and I‚Äôve now visited 6 times.

They have an amazing outdoor garden which plays very good background...electronic music, and the drinks are absolutely amazing. Their house cocktail - The Hampshire Garden - is incredibly delicious and you‚Äôll easily want to drink more than one of them! 

The service is very good. They have a huge team of waiters ready to serve whenever you need and they‚Äôre are all extremely friendly and attentive. The last time I visited we were served by Anwar who was excellent. 

As if all that wasnt going enough the FOOD is what will really keep you coming back. The butter chicken is genuinely one of the tastiest things I‚Äôve ever eaten. The keema naan is also amazing and my favourite starter is the Chilli  chicken. 

After all this I‚Äôve still not tried a dessert - I‚Äôm always too full but it‚Äôs definitely on my list next time.

We ordered the food in advance to make things easier but had to reduce numbers and alter orders slightly. Shawn was brilliant, responding...to our emails swiftly and sorting it all out.

On the night, a busy Saturday, the staff were very attentive and efficient, asking when we'd like the quite complex orders to be served. Drinks and poppadoms arrived without delay and the atmosphere in the lovely garden was buzzing and uplifting. 

All seasoned curry eaters, our party was highly impressed with the excellent quality of the dishes - the rogan gosht, chicken tikka masala and butter naans in particular. A great evening was had by all and the Hampshire is helping us get over the sad loss of the Anarkali down the road. We intend to do it again soon.

The Hampshire,"The resturant is in a well presented building. The inside was what you would expect with the name and the outside. Very crisp and clean although there was nobody eating inside.
Then we were taken through to a beautiful garden area. We really didn't expect...a lovely garden area smack bang in Hammersmith. Less of the eating area i think you understand that it is excellent
The menu was limited due to a flood however all the main dishes would tick most. We were told by the waiter that if we wanted something in particular that wasn't on the menu then the chef would make it. I personally think that is fantastic especially at this crazy covid time where lots of places are struggling. 
The food was fantastic and the homemade chutneys were great. Our main dishes tasted beautiful and the portion size was quite large. In fact my daughter and i could have shared a curry for sure
If you are in the area please try this place as i don't think you will be disappointed.
I nearly forgot cocktails are lovely too. We had quite a few mango ones :-)

I never made to the doors of the Hampshire, unfortunately my friend and I were running a few minutes late.
We called ahead to ensure the booking was secure and were met over the telephone by what I can only describe as the...most incompetent and rude staff I have ever encountered.
Not only were we made to feel guilty for a late running cab but were explicitly told that arriving late (5minites at most) was simply unacceptable.
When calling to notify and confirm our booking not only were staff considerably rude they also got the booking name incorrect at least 5 times before eventually we gave up and cancelled out booking to then be told we would be charged a ¬£40 fee.
Would not recommend in this climate dealing with the Hampshire over the telephone.

The food is excellent - lots of South Indian flavours alongside more traditional classics.  If you live in West London, you have a new neighbourhood staple.  If you live further afield, it is worth a trip.  I look forward to summer afternoons in the garden when the outside grill is fired up!

The Hampshire,"Dear  Catheriner 

Wow, thank you very much for taking your time to leave such a wonderful feedback.

Will definitely pass the compliments to the team.

Hope to see you soon.

The Hampshire,"Wow! Everything about this place was amazing! I‚Äôm so surprised that it‚Äôs not well known in the area. I‚Äôm local to chiswick and every time I‚Äôve been here all my friends have said it is the best Indian in the area. The paneer butter masala...was to die for and without a doubt the peshwari naan is the best I‚Äôve ever had. Equally, the decor is so beautiful, you can sit outside in their courtyard which has heaters, parasols and beautiful decorations. A perfect date night or get together with friends. This is really a place not to miss and I‚Äôm dreaming about the next time I can pop in.
"
The Hampshire,"Thank you so so much for your kind words, we're so glad you enjoyed your visit and will be sure to pass on your feedback to the team. Hope  you visit us again soon! Best Wishes, The Hampshire
"
The Hampshire,"What a brilliant find locally in W6. Delicious and authentic Indian food prepared by top Chef Barneet Singh, who assures me that they use fresh produce and not frozen, and wow the fried ""bindi"", and ""mogo"" was sublime as was my Salmon. Well done the...Hampshire. Great friendly service by all staff especially Anwar who looked after us well. Can't recommend this establishment higly enough. Great outdoor set up too with covered seating area, can't wait to try it out in the summer months. I wish The Hampshire was on the riverside on the other side of the A4. Look forward to visiting again soon. Prices generally on the ""high"" side but worth it.

A memorable evening.

√î Gourmet Libanais,"I should have written this review ages ago because we LOVE this restaurant and have been to it, or ordered delivery, many times. Everything on the menu has been great so it‚Äôs tricky to pick out favourites but tonight I‚Äôm trying their fish ratatouille for...this first time and it‚Äôs stellar. The falafel is reliably great but then so is everything else. We asked them to cater for our house warming last year (we live about 100m away) and it was fabulous.
"
√î Gourmet Libanais,"Have been here for dinner a number of times including with family, Lebanese friends and as a couple - every meal has been excellent.  Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, generous portions and quick service.

Can especially recommend their ""samke harra"" (fish rattatouile) which is cooked to...perfection.

If you're  a fan of Lebanese/Levantine food it's absolutely worth making the trip to Wandsworth to eat here - better than anything Edgware Road has to offer.
"
√î Gourmet Libanais,"This is a little gem hidden away in the gentrified super apartment blocks of Wandsworth.

An absolute delicious treasure trove of fresh lebanese cuisine. We couldn't get enough of it and kept ordering and eating!

The moutabal, hummus awarmah, tabbouleh were excellent. The mixed grill...had no elements that were dry or out of place. The fresh bread was soft and fluffy! But the real star of the show- the spicy potatos. I wouldn't be over exaggerating if I said these were the best spicy potatos in London!

It was a pleasure- very reasonably priced. If I'm ever back in Wandsworth, my stomach will drag me back here!

The Prince of Wales,"We visited The Prince of Wales after an exhausting (emotionally and physically!!) afternoon traipsing around the Imperial War Museum.
We were exhausted, very 'hangry' and dived in the nearest place which, luckily for us, was The Prince of Wales.
We were made to feel very...welcome, seats were available straight away and we were served at the table by the very friendly landlord (I'm assuming this, we didn't get his name unfortunately).
Our drinks were brought over almost immediately, and our food order placed. Our food came out in about 20 minutes and everything was delicious, generous but not over-the-top portion sizes and great value for money - especially as we were expecting 'London Prices'. 
We will definitely be back if we're up here again.
"
The Prince of Wales,"We come from Hastings for a day at the war museum. We took a short walk around the corner to watch football and a quick bite to eat. We ended up staying at the pub as the atmosphere was brilliant and food was very very...nice we had 2 pie mash and liquor the kids had chicken burger chips and chicken nuggets with chips and beans we ate it all. Great prices 
Will return
"
The Prince of Wales,"We were visiting the Imperial War Museum and instead of face the caf√© queue in the museum we looked for somewhere local to eat.
The pub is about 5 mins walk from the IWM, very easy to find, so was easy to walk there, eat...and go back to the museum.
Food was great - nice home cooked style and really big portions. Menus had lots of pub favourites too. Our cottage pie came with loads of extra gravy and piles of chips!
Staff were really welcoming and we were served really quickly.
Lovely comfortable pub with a really friendly atmosphere - definitely worth going for a proper sit down lunch if you're visiting the Imperial War Museum.
"
The Prince of Wales,"My son and I found this place by sheer luck, and it is now our favorite pub in London. After a tiring morning at the Imperial War Museum this pub provided amazing service and the most delicious Sunday roast. Both the beef and the lamb...were amazing, as was the crumble and custard for dessert. The location is siuper convenient near the Elephant and Castle tube station, but inside it feels like a village pub somewhere.
"
The Prince of Wales,"We came for a drink and a bite to eat. Very welcoming atmosphere, seems a good mix of locals and tourists alike. Great garden! We had fish and chips and some burgers, very generous portions and food was very nice at a decent price. Would...definitely recommend a visit üëå
"
The Prince of Wales,"We have known The Prince of Wales for many years and it was the obvious choice for the Reception following our Mother's Funeral in December 2021 and we were not disappointed.  Tom and Margaret are excellent hosts and you know your function is in very...good hands so there is no need to worry in advance.  They provided a lovely hot and cold buffet serving plenty of good quality, wholesome food and they made sure everyone was  catered for and made to feel welcome.  A very well run pub and reasonable bar prices.  The staff also provide excellent and friendly service. Thank you so much to Tom, Margaret and the Team.
"
The Prince of Wales,"My partner and I went to the Prince of Wales for a Sunday roast. As a celiac, I don‚Äôt often get many options at pubs. The service was amazing and I was catered for by the staff with my own beef roast including gluten free...Yorkshire puddings and gravy üòç I would really recommend the roasts here. The staff were so lovely and friendly, as were the other customers. Great price too.
"
The Prince of Wales,"This was hands down the best experience we had dining in the city. Sunday Roast was delicious, the staff was super attentive and polite, and Tom the owner personally went out of his way to see how we were doing. Be sure to make the...Prince of Wales a must visit!
"
The Prince of Wales,"We have visited this pub many many  times over the years . Tommy and Margaret are very welcoming hosts and all the staff work hard  to ensure that customers have the best experience.
The food on the menu is well priced, well cooked and we...have never been disappointed with our food choices.
We have been to the pub  to watch football matches , to just have a family meal or to attend a function . Most recently we held my Mum's funeral reception there and all the guests  commented on the lovely atmosphere , the  warm and friendly welcome and the excellent hot and cold buffet..
All areas of the pub are clean and comfortable and the outside area is a lovely addition .
Well done to Tommy , Margaret and all the Team  !

The Prince of Wales,"My aunt threw me a surprise 21st birthday at the pub and everything was just amazing. The owners are lovely and we had excellent service from all the staff. Margaret and Tom had gone above and beyond to decorate the pub and made a lovely...buffet. I have coeliac disease and all food made for the party had gluten free options. We had the garden area reserved and they had speakers throughout so we could play a good selection of our choice of music. Such a lovely pub and a great day filled with fun and laughter!

Our party of 3 ordered different meals and all were properly cooked and well presented. Generous portions and very reasonablt prices...for London. Service was excellent with Landlord and young lady who served us frequently checking that all was well.

We will definetly visit again if in the area.
"
The Prince of Wales,"We stumbled across the Prince of Wales after visiting the Imperial War Museum.
From the moment you walked in the door you were made to feel welcome, the staff were friendly and accommodating. 
We ordered food and drinks and whom I can only assume was...the landlord of the pub was an absolute star. Friendly and chatty and you can tell his customers were at the forefront of everything. 

We enjoyed a HUGE delicious meal and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service we received. 

You were made to feel as if you had been there before, not just stumbled in off the street. 
Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the war museum or anyone in the local area. 

Keep up the fantastic work, and it‚Äôs a shame not all pubs you go in these days are as welcoming and lovely as this one.
"
The Prince of Wales,"The service is impeccable and the food is exactly what you need on a weekday evening. We are always greeted by a smiling landlord who recommends the finest food (Double Pie and Liquor is a highlight) and the smoothest lagers (Fosters Top). The locals provide...you with the kind of atmosphere that East London is known for, watch out for the cheeky Irish pensioner at the bar, a local legend, he will keep you on your toes. The secluded secret garden is the hidden wonder, make your way past the eclectic  jukebox, through the conservatory and through the wooden fire door, I will let the courtyard speak for itself.

The Prince of Wales,"After visiting The Imperial War Museum myself and my son and 3 grandchildren were looking for somewhere to eat and came across this pub.

I highly recommend this restaurant whether it be for a quick start to a day of celebration or just for a quick breakfast/brunch! The portion sizes are also very good for the price! Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Dobar as it was my first time but I will definitely be returning ! A big thanks to the team for giving me and my family such a memorable and fun experience !!

Dobar,"Excellent customer service. Was greeted and seated as we entered the cafe. Breakfast was just mouth watering. I‚Äôve always dine at Cafe East but i have found a new favourite.
Presentation 5* Pancakes freshly baked , fruits were so fresh you thought they were freshly...picked, clotted cream tasted so fresh ,spinach was so fresh and tasty  and last but least avocado sprinkled with pomegranate was so flavoursome.

I was informed that on weekends you might encounter a queue for about 20mins . I‚Äôve only visited midweek .

It‚Äôs a small cafe but comfortable seating.

Highly recommended

Dobar,"Went to this restaurant with my sister, what a great place to go and have brunch! The food was so delicious, you get a mixture of savoury with sweet pancakes and fruit on the side. I had the American Dream and my sis had the...OMG! Both were delicious and washed down with strawberry smoothies. The service was very quick and the waiters were very attentive. My only critique is that they could have put ice in the tap water as it was very warm but apart from that it was 10/10 and we are planning our next visit.

Dobar,"Myself, my brother and sis were visiting London from Manchester and despite the many restaurants in London, we just had to return to Dobar for the excellent food and friendly staff. The weather was awful on the weekend and there was a long queue to...be seated, but the staff were really accommodating and set 1 hour seat time so that everyone didn't have to wait very long outside. The food was delicious and you get a variety of options, including a halal menu. The staff were really helpful and friendly. Aziz, the manager was really hospitable and asked if we didn't mind moving tables so that he could seat a family with children who were waiting outside, which we didn't mind doing at all. Can't wait to return soon once lockdown is over!

There was a small queue out front, but it went down quickly.. was only waiting for about 10 minutes. 
The staff were lovely!!!!!! 
The food here is soooo good! We both ordered...the OMG brunch, consisting of 2 pancakes, eggs (of your choice), bacon (meat free/halal available), 2 hash browns, maple syrup & a small bowl of fruit with creme fresh. 
I ordered a latte, which before i even drank it, a waiter asked if i needed a new one as it looked too strong..which i agreed & he bought a fresh one over!

I‚Äôll definitely be going back for more!

Dobar,"It was a last minute plan on a Saturday, we decided to go out for brunch and my sister suggested Dobar. I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised to walk into a bustling environment with a lovely vibe.
 We got there around...11.20 and it was packed already. I brought my two young children aged 5 and 6 and they ordered option 2 on the kids menu. I got an O.M.G. when our plates arrived I had to take a whole album full of pictures because it was so beautifully presented! The taste was amazing and everything was cooked to perfection, I asked for my eggs to be poached rather than fried and they were perfectly runny, the bacon was also cooked just right as I'm very fussy about that. My daughters absolutely loved it and finished everything on their plates (which is rare) the service from the waitresses was also very good and they were very attentive. If you want a dining experience go here!! Manor House is a bit out of my way but the journey was well worth it. Couldn't recommend more, will definitely be returning again soon!!!!üòçüòçüòçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü

Dobar,"You guys are fantastic! The warmth in your place is so inviting and quite clearly,  it's all from the heart, as we can all see. I visited your place last Sunday, we were a group of six. We are family to one another, we see...each other weekly, and we look forward to our Sundays breakfast meetings. It's so difficult to find a place that can cater for all and do it so effortlessly, offer beautiful service, and tasty food with a variety
You don't often get that. Sometimes there have been places where food has been good but service awful. And that's one of the most important things If you want to keep going back to a place. And at your place, staff welcomed us with a smile and followed that through to the end of our meals. So thank you so much and I'm looking forward to coming back this week, god willing. God bless you all.

Dobar,"Asked by my daughter to visit this lovely little place, and as usual, being my first time, I had to check the reviews. Wow, I was extremely pleased with my visit and so happy I went. There was a little bit of a queue which...lasted about 10 minutes, however, the waitress did keep us informed and even came to joke with us. The food was on another level, it looked sensational and tasted great. I‚Äôm not a big eater, but I had no problem finishing my choice because it was soo tasty. I live in Tottenham so I definitely will be a regular, but please support and give Dobar a go you will not be disappointed.

Dobar,"Staff really go out of their way to make sure you are happy, I am somewhat a coffee connoisseur and absolutely loved their coffee!

Juice was great too :) thank you

Dobar,"I drive past this place all the time and had seen their Instagram account which looked epic.

Today I drove past and decided to pull over and try Dobar and my god this place is incredible.

I ordered the OMG and it has to be...the best breakfast I have ever eaten hands down, cooked well, a selection of items that all compliment each other. This place has blown my mind and I will definitely be returning.

Staff are friendly and courteous and there is a selection to suit all needs from Vegan options to halal  versions of each item on the menu.

Benihana Chelsea,"We visited Benihana to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. Fantastic Teppanyaki experience. Very clean place. Our chef Marlon was very entertaining and friendly, he performed some cool tricks such as throwing egg yolk in the air on his spatula 

Our waitress Anne, was friendly and provided...excellent service, the same goes for the rest of the staff, they were super attentive.

The Teppanyaki is a little expensive, the food is good quality, the steak was excellent, melts in your mouth but the rest of the food was average, everyones tastebud is different. I personally thought the food lacked flavour, however, my husband and his friends loved it!

A few things to remember when visiting Benihana, firstly you share booth/ table. From my recollection I think it‚Äôs 8 per booth. Secondly the restaurant is very warm/hot (as expected, due to teppanyaki) Thirdly, the chicken and wagyu is Halal. 
Overall, lovely experience, great choice for a special occasions, pricey but worth the visit.

Benihana Chelsea,"My boyfriend and I were excited to visit Benihana for my birthday meal, but I have to say it fell short of expectations by a long way.  The biggest disappointment was how poor the service was. For the price we were paying, we were not...impressed. We arrived on time for our booking (on a Wednesday) and were told we had to wait in the lobby (for about 20 minutes in the end) for our table. When we arrived at our table, we had to repeat drink orders on three separate occasions because the server simply forgot.  

On top of this, when we arrived at our table we found the party of 6 who had arrived at the restaurant after us, were already seated. We were then told, when we asked to order the Seafood Palace, one of their set menus, that they could not include lobster because they had run out. 10 minutes later the server reappeared to say, sorry but the last two lobsters were going to be eaten by the party on our table, who had arrived later than us, and was this okay? I asked for a discount but was told prawns would be the replacement (already another part of the meal I'll add). We paid lobster prices for prawns with not even an offer of a discount.....to me this is unacceptable. And for good measure, we got to watch our neighbours eat their lobster in front of us!!

The food was nicely cooked, but fairly bland, and we enjoyed the show, but the service and lack of attentiveness just let down the entire experience and left us feeling irritated with a bill of over ¬£200 (Set menus are ¬£62 each).  Please value your customers more Benihana!

Benihana Chelsea,"I have eaten at Benihana in Dubai and the US.  On those occassions, the restaurants received a 5/5 from me.  But I was very disappointed yesterday.  Having seen the 'experience' of having my food cooked in front of me before, I was more interested in...the quality of the food.
The rice was tasteless, the prawns were slightly overcooked and thus too dry, the same for the scallops - which were of poor  quality and tasteless.
There were only 4 people on our table, two had asked for halal chicken.  I respect that, but as a result my steak was the last item to be cooked, the chef rushed the cooking and served me raw meat, I asked him to put it back and cook it more.  A few minutes later, it was fine.  But because I was last to be served and because the chef was in a hurry,  everything accompanying my dish was cold.
I did complain and the manager gave me an ¬£8 reduction off the ¬£126.00 bill.  Clearly he did not consider my complaint to have any seriousness.
A shame.  As all my previous memories of Benihana have been very good.  Not this one.

Benihana Chelsea,"Birthday occasion to remember. We were promptly seated, though we had arrived a bit early. From start to finish we were  attended by the superb Daniela, a true master of her craft. There was no detail left unseen to and clearly she has many years...experience. 

Firstly we were seated with menus and offered drinks from the bar, a small detail some establishments overlook while you peruse the food menu.

Next the food order was taken, to give the chef time to prepare, as the food is cooked in front of you of course. Daniela was patient with everyone at our table and explained everything clearly, demonstrating her in depth knowledge of the beverages and food on offer - she was even happy to recommend a dish or two, and we were glad we followed her advice.

Daniela was attentive enough to carryout some special birthday requests I had for the occasion which I greatly appreciated! They even made a big deal of other birthdays while we were there which was a lot of fun, though not my style. But that is a personal preference.

Throughout the meal, I never had to look far to grab her attention, whether it was for a napkin, some sauce, or another drink. She was truly top class and the main reason this review is 5/5! 

On to the chef and the food and, not expecting anything less, the performance and delivery was second to none. Angel was our attending chef, who also has evident experience in his trade. Apart from his witty humour, engagement with customers and array of party tricks he whipped out effortlessly while cooking to order individual main courses, what stood out about all of this was the quality of the food - cooked to perfection.

We had one chicken dish and another seafood mixture, both exquisite and prepared with ease by Angel. I have never eaten scallops more perfectly cooked, which can be tricky, never mind with 8 customers staring at you. The lobster tail was also cooked just right!

Overall, it was truly a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend for any occasion! It was pricy, though worth it! I would love to return some day for the Wagyu! 

PS whoever came up with the idea for the Sakura Cocktail needs to trademark it! Outstanding!!!

Benihana Chelsea,"Went for lunch today - a really underwhelming experience. Chose 2 items between us from their lunch menu - Prawn & Chicken Yakisoba with salad and miso, and mixed sushi platter. The meal itself took 25 minutes to come in an empty restaurant and when...it did came without the salad and miso. When asked about this at the end they realised their mistake and knocked the 12.5% optional service charge off. How generous.

The Yakisoba itself was diabolical, one diced prawn and microscopic quantities of chicken. It was drowned in a really terrible, watery sauce and tasted nothing like authentic versions we‚Äôve had - pretty lousy from a Japanese restaurant. The sushi was standard shop bought sushi and we thought that someone in the kitchen has probably run out and bought a ¬£3 box from Tesco and served it up as their own.

Really blame ourselves for the rushed decision. Sticks and Sushi is about 5 doors down for the same price and we could have got better quality at Itsu five doors the other direction for half the price. Avoid for their lunch menu, although the teppanyaki seemed to be running a lot better.

"
Benihana Chelsea,"Booked here on a Sunday early evening.  I would imagine you would always need to book.  Went to the Piccadilly restaurant in the past for a business lunch and enjoyed the spectacle so took wife and 14 year old son.  If you don't like sharing...you will need to book for 6-8 people I believe as there are 8 seats at each grill.  There are quite a few grills close together, so it gets quite noisy.  As long as you expect that it isn't an issue. Our fellow diners were fine, but I can imagine that wouldn't always be the case....
We had some sushi, wagyu, chateaubriand, scallops and lobster tail along with various vegetables with some rice.  All of which were excellent and, needless to say, served piping hot.    The chef cooks this all in front of you on the hot plate and does a little show with the various ingredients - onions become a chimney, spells out words with the rice, etc.,    Service was attentive and the staff were very pleasant.  Not cheap, but well worth it as a treat.  We will return.
"
Benihana Chelsea,"Hi Noodlesausage - thank you so much for the 5-star rating and the excellent review. As you picked some of our favourite dishes (wagyu, chateaubriand, scallops and lobster), we are delighted to hear that chef looked after you. We look forward to welcoming you again...
"
Benihana Chelsea,"Have been to several Benihana restaurants over recent years. Last time in Mayfair a year ago was the same as this visit - totally underwhelming, disappointing and over-priced.
When the chefs put on a show and bring things to life, the place can be quite...special and different. But if you get a totally professional but dull chef like we did again this time, you feel totally short changed. You're paying way over the odds in order to get a special experience. If you've been before and had that or if you see that happening on other tables with other chefs, it rubs in even more that you're better off not over-spending on this place if you dont fancy such massive inconsistency. 
This was a night out for my son's birthday and he was totally disappointed.
Atmosphere is dull, deco is dull, lounge waiting area has nothing on a decent bus stop (!), eating area is banal, eating with folks you don't know next to you is an acquired taste and not something you seem to be able to opt out of even if there are free tables, staff look pretty disinterested, ... and i'd be surprised if anyone from the restaurant does much about this feedback either tbh. 
Save your money!

Benihana Chelsea,"Partner booked for my birthday, we had a  table of 8 . 
Following our experience at the Piccadilly restaurant that is now closed , we thought it would equally be  as good . Unfortunately this was not the case . We booked the table for...2.30 and was not told at the time this was at the end or their service which finished at 3pm  - the venue is very small, you feel your in small box ./room so  No ambience .  Dirty dishes all on view to the side as your eating , very slow at clearing plates away . 

Chef was good , service was awful . Ordered bottles of wine ,  wasn‚Äôt even offered with a bottle cooler , it was just left warming  up on the side , with it being really warm in the room , it was extremely poor service   . 
Toilets were dirty , place felt un clean . 
Food ok but have had better in other similar style restaurants , it was disappointing and couldn‚Äôt wait to get the bill and go . 

Shame as this has put me off ever going back, and put a dampener on my day out !

"
Benihana Chelsea,"The best restaurant we have ever been too. 
Very clean and friendly staff as soon as we walked in. 
As we went for lunch time menu (3pm) it was quite quiet as
We a very hot day in London.  

Taken to our seats and as...we were on our own we had a personal chef just for us two cooking our food. 

Meave the waitress was so lovely. Nothing was a hassle. Very friendly and showed us how to access to menu online and asked us if we would like a fork as well. This was a nice touch as people can feel quite embarrassed asking for one when not able to use chop sticks. We obliged but still gave the chop sticks a good go all part of the experience. 

Jason the chef was funny, kind and very knowledgable about the food on offer. He made us laugh so much. 

The detail into the preparation of the food was unreal. I‚Äôve never seen food cooked this was and it was amazing. 

Fun with Jason throwing food into our mouths. Very entertaining. Once all the food was prepared and served Jason departed to allow us to enjoy. Servers checked on us when they felt the needed to. 

All in all a brilliant experience. 

Only minor negatives. We asked for no prawns in our starter  (we aren‚Äôt allergic or anything. Just don‚Äôt like them) there must have been a mix up between the server and chef and the chef brought them out to prepare. Yes -
We could have said when he initially brought them out but we didn‚Äôt. And out of politeness we tried one tiny bite. 

Another minor issues was 12.5% optional service charge included. Thought that was a bit cheeky. We paid this as we thought the service/food was amazing. But like the personal option to chose. 

Would recommend this place to anyone. We will return. The walk along Kings Road is also so lovely.

The menu was extensive with many Indian and Persian choices , and a variety of spicy and not so spicy selections.

The lamb biryani used to be...fresh with big pieces of lamb with a fresh salad on top. What i got today was very oily soggy rice,  tiny few pieces of lamb no flavour, no salad nothing. It was barely mild almost cold just disgusting is the only word i can describe it. Chicken korma was so dry the breast pieces were hard to chew. Mint sauce missing. Just awful we paid almost ¬£50 for the food we got and everyone was so disappointed it was such a horrible meal. Such a shame that the prices have also increased when the quality has gone down. Such a shame because we used to really enjoy it as its our local.

The Rajdoot Hampstead,"This is the old Fleet Tandoori which will be remembered fondly by those of a certain vintage.The food was good, the ambience classic (by which we mean flock wall paper and dim lighting) and the clientele a cosmopolitan mix of professionals from the Royal Free...Hospital next door and Hampstead intellectuals. Well time passes and flock wall paper is replaced by purple neon and chrome but the good news is that the hospitality and the food has, if anything, got even better. Management has passed to a younger generation but Father (Grandfather?) still patrols the front of house to make sure customers are happy and one suspects he maintains a disciplinarian eye in the kitchen also to ensure standards do not slip. The staff are friendly (perhaps a tiny bit too intrusive but on the night my friend and I went the staff outnumbered the customers so maybe this was inevitable) and the food the best you can possibly expect at this price point. Well worth making a detour for.

Awesome Thai #Finchley,"I found this Thai Restaurant on Google & Trip Advisor, and after seeing their 4.8 Star Reviews on Google & 5 Star Reviews on trip Advisor, I thought I'd give it a try. 

It was my Daughter's 22nd Birthday so I reserved a table on...the Day for 5 of us.

First impressions was that it was a really nice looking Restaurant from the outside and inside too. 

We were greeted by a Waiter called Watt who checked our reservation and then seated us at a table for 6 by the front Window so there was plenty of room as there was only 5 of us. 

We were given complimentary Starters which was a really nice touch, and a Glass of Filtered Water each which they kept topping up every time our Glasses were low. 

The Manageress Dee took our order and even recommended a dish or two and all the food was very fresh and tasted amazing.

We had 5 Drinks, 5 Starters, 5 Mains and 3 Desserts, one of which was free as they used it with a Lighted Candle to sing Happy Birthday to my Daughter which was another nice gesture, and all this for just under ¬£108, & no Service Charge either.

I would definitely recommend this Restaurant and as the name suggests, it is, AAA Standard 
Awesome, Amazing, & Affordable xx

Awesome Thai #Finchley,"We have a couple of good Thai restaurants in the Finchley area, but this place beats them all. We arrived without a reservation, and even midweek they were quite busy but managed to accommodate us.
The menu is fairly comprehensive, and they cater for vegetarians...by substituting tofu or beancurd for meat or chicken in a lot of dishes. We asked for all our dishes to be prepared 'phet phet', really spicy by Thai not English standards, and so they were!
The som tom papaya salad was so fresh and juicy and very spicy, indeed. The traditional cabbage wedge had been replace by salad leaves, but that didn't detract too much from the authenticity. The deep fried tofu was a dish new to me, served with a lovely dip. Our vegetarian panaeng curry, and the chili and basil stir fry were awesome, fantastic flavours and a good mix of vegetables. Coconut rice was an excellent side dish. I couldn't resist their Thai tiramisu. There was nothing particularly Oriental about it, but it was very yummy.
Service was charming and hospitable throughout. In true Thai style, you were made welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Our bill was GBP49 before tip (they do not levy a service charge) for our meal,  including a couple of glasses of wine from their rather good wine list. A definite must go! We'll be back soon!
"
Awesome Thai #Finchley,"As soon as we entered, we were warmly welcomed by the lovely staff who were incredibly kind the whole evening. We were treated to complimentary prawn toast and ordered around 4 starters all of which were delicious. For mains we had Pad Thai and Massaman...curry. Having been to a lot of Thai restaurants this spot is a true gem and was the best Thai meal I've ever had! To top it all off the bill was incredibly cheap: ¬£40 for 4 people. Ambient lighting is important to me and the restaurant had it spot on! Can't wait to come back very soon :)
"
Awesome Thai #Finchley,"Had our first takeaway from Awesome Thai, will definitely look to visit when restaurants reopen.

We have tried a number of Thais in the area, including the very good one that was on the same site. 

We had four different dishes all very tasty, with...very large portions for the green and yellow curries.  Had asked about dishes being made gluten-free, I could hear the reception checking with the kitchen, as to which we could or could not have.  Those that were gluten free were very clearly marked.

The inside of the restaurant has had a make over, and new owners have really modernised the look, the decor was getting a bit jaded.

Awesome Thai #Finchley,"First time I went here as it had been recommended by a friend. I was not disappointed. The food was delicious  - flavourful,  great portion sizes, arrived quickly. The service was excellent - attentive waiters kept our water glasses topped up, happy to take photos....We felt 1 of the pad thai was saltier then the others and they quickly replaced it with another with correct salt levels without any quibbles. I would definitely go again.

We had a prawn pur√©e &popadoms for starters followed by a delicious mango chicken &a spicy lamb korai with cheese &garlic naan &mushroom rice. All were excellent &washed down with a complimentary pint of Cobra beer &a glass of house wine. We also received a complimentary glass of‚ÄôBaileys‚Äô after our meal.

Having been warmly greeted by the manager,Tony, we were ushered to our tables and we browsed through the menu at our leisure with no pressure from the waiting staff. I strongly recommend viewing the menu prior to visiting the restaurant because every dish on the menu sounds so beautiful it can be hard to make a choice !!!.
My wife only drinks sparking Rose wine and they took the time to fetch a bottle for her as this was not on the drinks menu.
The food was excellent very flavoursome and having travelled extensively throughout India, it met our expectations.

Eastern Eye Balti House,"Excellent service, well balanced and tasty food!

We were on our way to the BrewLDN Festival nearby and wanted to get a curry beforehand. After haggling with a few merchants on Bricklane, we received a spectacular deal with Eastern Eye Balti House, for ¬£15pp (approx....¬£17pp including service charge). The price included 1 appetiser, 1 main, 2 sides each (rice and naan), and 2 large drinks each.

We were a group of 4 people and ordered Lamb Samosa, Onion Bhaji, and Seekh Kebabs for our starters. My Seekh Kebab was delicious and my friends confirmed that they enjoyed their appetisers as well.

For mains, we ordered the Paneer Korai, Paneer Jalfrezi, Chicken Madras and Lamb Biryani. We thoroughly enjoyed the mains; I particularly enjoyed the chicken madras sauce, it was very delicious. The Paneer Korai was a bit sweet for me but that's only due to personal preference as I prefer savoury / spicy dishes; my friend who ordered it really enjoyed it. I tried a bit of the Paneer Jalfrezi's sauce, which was good. My Lamb Biryani was well spiced. It had a nice kick to it which I really liked, and I do love biryanis. I would definitely have this biryani from here again!

Overall, we were very pleased by the service received from Shamim and Mojid, who looked after us very well. We were also pleasantly surprised when they offered us a round of shots on the house at the end of our meal!

If I could give them 6 out of 5 stars for the quality of service and treatment received, I wouldn't hesitate to. We left the place in really good spirits, feeling quite full after a satisfying meal.

I hope to visit again soon!

Eastern Eye Balti House,"We booked a table of 4 for 5pm and when we arrived we were the only people there for about 30 minutes or so. We first ordered some popadoms and then had to wait another 15-20 minutes to order our mains. During this wait, the...waiter was just stood at the bar eating and playing on his phone whilst we were quite clearly waiting to order.  Finally got to order but our table still wasn‚Äôt cleared. The waiter wouldn‚Äôt have cleared the starter plates until we told him to. 

 The food was amazing and couldn‚Äôt fault it all. It‚Äôs such a shame because we‚Äôve been here before and couldn‚Äôt fault any of it but now I wouldn‚Äôt go back there again. Not because of the food but the service. Not a single smile and to be honest just lazy service. However, the doorman was very nice, the most helpful person at the restaurant and he wasn‚Äôt even inside. 

To sum up, amazing food but not great service which ruined the whole experience.

We arrived early a Saturday for lunch, the welcoming was...very nice and the atmosphere very friendly and relax. We order Octopus, pork belly, tuna tacos, yucca fries and one of the most delicious aubergine that I tried on my life.We order a red wine following the advice from the waiter/sommelier, a merlot from Brazil very good and great on the price.  After a full coma we didn't order dessert but order a tea and the house invite us to a digestive liquor. As well we enjoyed the pictures displayed on the walls and the work that this restaurant do introducing artist from South America to London
"
Paladar,"We visited on a warm Saturday, sitting outside on the terrace(pick your position carefully as it can get very hot in certain spots- the staff tell you this).
Lovely friendly service from Dani & everyone.
The cocktails were smooth and elegantly presented. 
The octopus dish...on the menu was cooked wonderfully, but if i was to go back there I would not order again- is expensive for the portion size. Otherwise the tapas style dishes were great and we left feeling pleasantly full. Memorable highlights include the tuna dish and  cassava chips, 
We had purple corn churros and a corn pudding with cheese ice cream for dessert. Both were delicious. The churros were crisp, light and fluffy not flaccid and greasy and came with wonderful sauces- the coffee laced dulce de leche was beautiful and the chilli chocolate had a reviving zing. Churros were the star of the menu.
Looking at the other dishes going to other diners I was thinking 'i would like to try that when i come back'.

Paladar,"Four of us had the tasting menu, with accompanying drinks, for Saturday lunch. Everything was superb. Food was delicious, varied, interesting and generous too; drinks paired wonderfully well.

We came to celebrate 25 years since we met on a trip around South America and we can't imagine finding a better restaurant for the occasion...or indeed any occasion!  
We were ""splashing out"" as it was a very special occasion, we don't normally spend this sort of money on a meal out, but it was absolutely worth it - we will definitely be finding an excuse to come back!
"
Paladar,"Dear sir/Madame
I received an email for some time ago asking if I wanted to leave a review and I feel it would be good to do so.
I went to celebrate my mothers birthday and we were all excited to visit the restaurant as...they had so good reviews. The food was tasty but for the price of the taster menu it did not live up to expectations unfortunately.
When we were served the third round the lovely head waiter was not inside the restaurant and we had to go and ask for the pared wine as the food was served before and was starting to get cold. When we got the wine (after having to ask for it) we were served a white wine by the (not so busy) waiter from the bar. However, the wine was meant to be red wine and when it had finally been poured in the glades and ready to be brought to us by a waiter, nothing happened. This resulted in my father having to get up and bringing the wine to our table. When he got the wine at the bar and turned around a waiter walked past him quickly which unfortunately resulted in my dad spilling the wine on himself, the waiter and my mother.
The head waiter came back in and apologised saying that he should have paid more attention to us and the others, which was kind nice of him to say and notice.
The way the manager and waiter wanted to resolve this turned out in 4 X free drinks and shots with the manager and head waiter.
Now, had my sister and I been out with friends it would have been appropriate but sitting with our parents it was very awkward. Finally we did not feel that the service charge added to the bill should have been for a total of ¬£51 as we did not get the service equal to this price.
The food we were served was tasty but unfortunately in the end it will not be a place we will revisit.

Paladar,"I pre booked a table for 2 on Friday for the la hora loca (happy hour 2 for 1 on drinks) and a main meal,  having high expectations after reading reviews.
The confusion started almost immediately, there is not a list for the 2 for...1 drinks as only around two or three cocktails are included ( magerita/ mojito ) plus wine or bottled beer so pretty underwhelming to be honest.
Throughout the meal the waiter seemed panicked and it was hard to get his attention to order more drinks.

After ordering food it arrived without a portion of rice and with an extra bowl of  Chips which we sent back but our rice never arrived.
We had a someone else's plantain fries given to us, to which we told the waiter belonged to the table on our left.
The food itself was nice but overpriced for tappas due to the small portion sizes. 
Other tables were given wrong drinks also so this must be a recurring theme, we left still hungry and disappointed with the service given so afraid to say we won't be returning.

The service is friendly but professional with waiters who manage to be attentive without being obtrusive - not an easy balance to achieve.

Inside is pleasant but I didn‚Äôt see too much of it as we were seated in the courtyard at the back, on a sunny September day. The covered courtyard is delightful...in a rustic way (I wonder if they used it pre-pandemic?) with plants bordering the tables and artworks on the walls, and well ventilated if that‚Äôs important to you. 

Service from both the manager and our waiter was excellent and very friendly. I have criminally forgotten the name of our server (his name began with a J) but he was brilliant and should be commended. 

The food we had was very good - I can‚Äôt vouch for its geographical authenticity but who cares if you enjoy it? It‚Äôs a tapas vibe where you are expected to order a few things and possibly share around. This didn‚Äôt work as well for us as Dining Companion is a meat eater and I am not. J tried to time dishes to keep it relaxed which meant we had eaten most of the veggie things before I had to watch DC eating her pork tacos. But that‚Äôs not Paladar‚Äôs or J‚Äôs fault. Next time I would know to clarify that when we order. 

Highlights: the plantain crisps came with hands down the best guacamole I have ever tasted, and the jackfruit empanadas with the serrano chilli dip were delicious. The cheese and tapioca croquettes were OK but didn‚Äôt grab me - maybe a bit too subtle amongst all the other spices. DC‚Äôs pork pibil went down a storm (sample quote: ‚Äúvery tasty‚Äù). We had the purple corn churros for dessert which were really really tasty. Habanero mojitos to drink were very good. 

For five dishes, two cocktails and dessert the bill came to around ¬£90. I struggle a little bit with value for money. It‚Äôs good food done with passion clearly, excellent service. But the tapas description is a bit at odds with some of the prices for the meat and fish dishes, which come close to ¬£20 in places, and are more like main courses in size. 

Overall though, great restaurant and we will be back.

Paladar,"After visiting Paladar once and having an incredibly positive experience I went again last week. To start with, the barman was not happy where the host sat us and complained to him in Spanish, I politely said in Spanish we‚Äôre more than happy to move...wherever it was more comfortable for them and moved seats. My partner ordered a cocktail that was too sweet, when he politely asked the barman if it was intended to be that sweet he answered ‚Äúof course‚Äù and made no effort to ask if he could change anything (my partner ended up pouring water to dilute it so it was drinkable). Once seated there were delays getting the menus and there was a mistake in the wine ordered, it appears that the waitress was new and not very clear on the list which caused delays. We ordered the pork tacos that come with six tortillas to prepare yourself, we used them and had quite a bit of ingredients left so requested for extra tortillas. Again, the waitress was not sure if this was even possible but returned with two more tortillas a few minutes later - these extra tortillas were charged ¬£1 each in the bill. It was a disappointing experience in comparison to the first time, a real shame as the food is really nice!

Paladar,"Dear Melina, 

I am very sorry to hear that your visit last Friday did not live up to expectations. 

It was a busy evening, and frankly we have been currently struggling with a shortage of service staff recently. We have several new members of the...
"
Paladar,"The food was great, lets just get that clear... however we were sat right next to the toilet for one. The waitress was nice enough but found it hard to explain all the dishes, there was also a lack of English explanation regarding what each...item was (anyone know what a Aji Panca paste is?). I then ordered a cocktail that was basically a desert as a result so had to order an extra beer once it arrived. 

One guy was cool, the rest of the staff were pretty cold and mechanical - however I would definitely go back for either a table outside or to have a go on the tasting menu
"
Paladar,"Had a fabulous lunch at Paladar last Saturday!
We sat in the beautiful outside dining area which has been decorated to reflect the South American theme of the restaurant and felt that we were in fact eating in that country!
The food itself was absolutely...fabulous. We were ably assisted by the Front of House Manager, Yalain, who was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He gave us advice on what to order and the size of the portions etc.
Thanks to him, we had plantain crisps, roasted chickpeas, tuna, prawns and octopus.
We also got through cocktails, an outstanding rose from Uruguay and after dinner drinks.
The whole experience was amazing and I have no hesitation in recommending Paladar to anyone looking for a different and exciting dining experience!
"
Paladar,"I booked the chef's table to celebrate my birthday with friends and couldn't be happier with the whole experience. The chef's table was essentially a separate room with a window facing streetview on one side, and the kitchen on the other. We opted for Chef...Jose's Tasting Menu and it was perfection. Personal favorites were the tapioca croquettes, beef empanadas, tuna tostadas, wild mushroom quinotto, and churros smothered in dulce de leche. (It's impossible to choose just one!) The service was warm and attentive, the server taking time to explain each course as it was served. Overall it just was the ideal atmosphere for a laidback celebration, or any time you want to experience authentic, high quality Latin food. A must visit!
"
Paladar,"This restaurant was highly recommended by friends and we were not disappointed! The cocktails ( well we were early and it was happy half price hour!) we‚Äôre terrific and the wine list not over priced. The four of us ordered 6 small plates, each with...four portions . The tastes were amazing and the service excellent!
Great food , great value!
"
Paladar,"After reading the reviews I was very excited for the first post lockdown meal out here! Unfortunately I found myself slightly disappointed. The service was not good we found we spoke with the waiter maybe 3 times the whole evening and drinks etc took a...long time. 

The vibe is lovely on the terrace and really we heated- felt like eating inside which was great. 

The food was also slightly disappointing - we found it quite average and overpriced for the portions. Overall we had a nice evening but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to a friend.
"
Paladar,"Thank you for your comments and I am delighted that you enjoyed dining in our heated courtyard garden and that overall you had a nice evening. 

I have checked your booking and I believe you dined with us at a particularly busy time on Friday...
"
Paladar,"Absolutely amazing service from everybody here. The kitchen and staff were kind enough to accommodate our booking even though we ran 30 mins late (we had called in advance as there were problems with the trains). The food came out promptly and was delicious. We...had the set lunch menu and enjoyed everything we ordered, in particular the pulled pork tacos and the cheese croquettes. One of the best cocktails I've had (cucumber pisquino). The staff were so so nice and friendly - I couldn't have asked for more from the service and would definitely come back. Thank you for a lovely lunch.

Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"Visited Manuel's restaurant today with my little one and was treated like a Royal family. The service was amazing, starting from the professionally served and presented food, and finishing with babysitting. We normally struggle to eat in peace as our little one is a very...energetic child. The owner saw us struggling and took our baby boy for a while, so we could enjoy the delicious Dover sole and turbot. Food was perfectly cooked, well seasoned and served on a hot plates. The gnocchi were just melting in our mouths.  I would definitely recommend this place especially for a family outing as there is lots of space for the buggy. Will definitely visit again soon.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"I don't have enough words to tell you how much me, my sister and friends all adore and love Manuel's! We celebrated so many important birthdays here, new jobs, business successes. Any time we want to celebrate we come to Manuel's! The live music acts...are always great and so much fun, expect to be up dancing by the end of the night. The food is impeccable, the crab ravioli is something really really special. As is the aubergine and mozzarella starter, the lobster, the bruschetta, the tiramisu! Every single thing I've eaten here has been incredible. The homemade limoncello is also out of this world - as someone who doesn't like limoncello I would even buy a bottle of this to take home. The service is kind, tentative without being fussy, and everyone makes you feel so welcome, Roberto is a sweetheart and Manuel the owner and chef will often come out to greet you and chat at the end of the night. I come here often and always will as long as they are here. LONG LIVE MANUEL'S! You are an asset to our community.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"There's nothing like a good Sunday roast lunch, and with only two of us it is not economical to do it at home very often.
We have greatly enjoyed eating in at Manuel's in the past, and our takeaway Sunday lunch this week was as...good as it could be short of the normal table service.
We got the usual friendly welcome when we arrived, and within a few minutes our pre-ordered roast lamb, slightly rare as requested, in generously carved portions, was brought to us.  It was accompanied with a range of carefully cooked al dente vegetables.  
Soon got home to where our plates were gently warming in the oven, and enjoyed a real treat.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"Having been forced to quarantine following a trip to an amber list country, my husband and I chose to celebrate freedom with a trip to our favourite restaurant. Our previous visit was Sunday 16th May, one day before we were allowed to eat inside restaurants...again and it was raining.
It was so nice to be able to sit inside by the patio doors open to a pretty garden of exotic potted plants.
What I love about this place is the attention to detail e.g. white table cloths and napkins, very attentive staff, food beautifully presented and cooked exactly to your preference as well as the complementary limoncello.
The menu is extensive with a good selection of wines. Service is unhurried. Looking forward to our next visit.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"To have a local restaurant of many years standing still producing top quality food with outstanding service feels like a privilege. Delicious seafood and top quality meat served sliver service by familiar faces. Absolutely loved this and hope Manuel and his team continue to thrive...despite COVID restrictions.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"Me and my sister visited Manuel's for the first time tonight and the food was incredible! I had the seafood soup followed by the rump steak which is on the bone and cooked to perfection and I can honestly say it was the best steak...I can remember. It was accompanied by lovely perfectly cooked veg. 
My sister had mussels and (gluten free) beef ragu pasta. We were so impressed by them catering for our gluten free and gluten and dairy free diets (!) not easy customers. The staff were lovely and very thoughtful, portions were very generous and it is a family friendly place.
Whilst I can see some of the regulars really enjoy the music and it gives a community vibe, we more wanted to catch up and we felt the food speaks for itself so we will be coming back again for sure but may choose a different night. 
Thank you for an amazing evening! We will be back.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"With an oval table to seat 22 people we had a warm welcome from the staff, head chef and owner. Service was very organised and attentive but not intrusive.  All the meals were executed beautifully and were extremely delicious. From chilli prawns, stuffed aubergines, scallops,...squid to name just a few starters to mains of mushroom risotto, seafood tagliatelle, steak, sea bass, chicken and desserts of bread and butter pudding, pear tart, passion fruit panna cotta, tiramisu, cr√®me br√ªl√©e plus more. Whether for a large family gathering or just a couple, a wonderful and authentic Italian restaurant. Would highly recommend.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"I live in Milton Keynes so it‚Äôs quite a way to travel 2.5 hours by car despite only being 58  miles away.   So when I was invited to a friends birthday party I was nearly put off by the timescales.  However I can only say...it was well worth the trip and I am so glad I went.  The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are friendly, polite and very professional.   The food was outstanding. I knew the steak was going to be fabulous the moment I realised I wasn‚Äôt being offered a steak knife because it wasn‚Äôt needed.  It was perfectly cooked and cut like butter.  The dessert was the best lemon tart I‚Äôve ever had.  It was cooked to perfection with light crisp pastry,  I knew from the first mouthful it was made on the premises.   Will I go back?  If I get the chance most definitely.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"We celebrated a family birthday at this friendly, lively, neighbourhood Italian ristorante at the heart of Gypsy Hill. We enjoyed a melange of fish & pasta dishes, with outstanding desserts - special kudos to the Tiramsu! Dietary (eg non-dairy) requirements were catered for, and staff...adhered to COVID-safety conscious service. We shall return! Buon' appetito!
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"My girlfriend happened across this delightful place so for it was a find a then some. Situated on the corner of Gipsy Hill toward Dulwich this restaurant is well serviced by local transport and it appeared to have some on street parking available on Gipsy...Hill itself.

The staff were wonderful and made great recommendations on drinks and specials. To say the food was lovely would be an understatement. The scallop starter is highly recommended! My girlfriend and I both had the Halibut with season veg and it was delicious. Desserts were tasty and we also enjoyed a lovely digestive spirit and limoncello.

Outside eating was fine, granted the road noise is present, but we didn't find it detract from our lunch. We plan to return for a later meal and hopefully indoors once the restrictions are lifted.

Top notch in every aspect and it seems we are not alone in thinking so - as so many reviews here seem to agree.
"
Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"With the recent news of our daughters engagement, we looked for a good restaurant not too far from home. When we saw the glowing reports for Manuel‚Äôs, we decided to see if we could get a table for our group of 5. Manuel promised to...call back in the afternoon to see if he could accommodate us and sure enough he did and was able to give us a table outside. We then ran late after visiting relatives so l called up to continue him to which he replied, ‚Äòno problem‚Äô. Our table was waiting for us when we arrived and the heaters went on so we wouldn‚Äôt get cold. Manuel and his staff were all very friendly, attentive and obviously extremely accommodating! The food was delicious and everyone enjoyed their meal, including the gorgeous homemade desserts. It was the perfect place to celebrate with our daughter and future son-in-law. My husband & l plan to return for a date night sometime and seeing that the train station is in walking distance will mean we can enjoy an extra glass of that delightful Malbec! üç∑  üòä

Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"Returned after lockdown, and we had a wonderful meal. A variety of dishes - scallops, duck liver salad, fried aubergine followed by lamb shank, calves liver and fillet steak - all beautifully cooked, and served with delicious mini roast potatoes and a selection of fresh...vegetables. Can't fault the food or service, despite the restaurant being full on a Friday night. Manuel emerged from the cooking during the evening and went around the tables to get feedback directly from customers - thought this was a very nice touch. Highly Recommended.

Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,"We came for my partner's 50th birthday this evening. We had a lovely evening and the food was delightful. For starters, I had the king prawns which were HUGE, cooked perfectly and so juicy. My partner had the crab and prawn cocktail, which she loved....For mains I had lamb rack, cooked perfectly medium as requested and a generous portion. My partner had the seafood risotto, which had a generous selection of mussles, prawns, clams and squid. The waiter brought out our dessert with a candle and played happy birthday and it just made our evening that bit extra special. The tiramasu was AMAZING. I couldn't eat much of it but it was so good. It felt very covid secure and the blankets and heaters made us forget we were outside. Would highly recommend for any special occasions.

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"8.00pm reservation on a Saturday night via ""Open Table'   plus invited to confirm booking the day before by text. Arrived at 7.45pm but table already available albeit restaurant very busy and buzzing atmosphere. Staff never asked for my name so disappointed to be later informed...that we had not showed for our reservation and our reasons why !!!
Had onion soup and pan fried prawns for starters which were ok. The 10oz fillet and 10oz rib eye steaks were both beautiful. I had to return my ""cold"" french fries but they were quickly replaced. For dessert we had cr√®me brulee and sticky toffee pudding both ok. 
Together with two cocktail aperitifs and a bottle of of Argentian Malbec the bill came to ¬£142.
We enjoyed the experience. The staff were very obliging but the service was slow which suited ourselves allowing us to chill between courses. We will definitely return.
"
Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"We‚Äòve been coming here for 4 years, it‚Äòs our restaurant of choice for the first night every time we come to London.
The place has held up its standards throughout the years and still offers great food at a reasonable price.
Okay, the cooking your...steak (partly) yourself can be a little inconvenient if you just want it perfectly done for you. And it means you must sit there and watch other guest kill and overcook a perfectly nice steak.

Other than hat we have had anything‚Äôs we didn‚Äôt thoroughly enjoy and we have never seen even a single unfriendly or incompetent waiter. In fact, our last waitress Ledina was absolutely awesome.

If you are into fine dining, this migh not be the place for you, it‚Äôs not a fancy place. It‚Äôs simple but it delivers every time. It‚Äôs a great place with a very special athmosphere - especially but not exclusively around the Holidays.
"
Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"We have visited a couple of the other Steak & Co restaurants so we were looking forward to our meal. We arrived at our booked time and gave our details to the host, she then proceed to take the details of the couple behind us...and then disappeared. We saw her walking round in circles and speaking with other staff members, it became clear that our table wasn‚Äôt quite ready although that wasn‚Äôt communicated we just had to stand and wait while this was sorted. We then took a seat and found a similar issue to the other restaurants and that‚Äôs that the tables are too small and too crammed together. Anyway after waiting a while we placed an order and the waitress appeared to make a dig that neither of us had chosen an alcoholic drink. The drinks arrived my partner had ordered the alcohol free beer, instead of asking if he wanted a glass the waitress simple poored half of it in very poorly so it ended up mostly head. After a bit longer the food arrived and this is where the size of the table is extremely frustrating. The young lad serving was obviously quite new so didn‚Äôt ask about sauces etc so we had to get someone‚Äôs attention, the ketchup is a glass bottle (I hate these) and the mustard was a full pot no spoon given so pretty unhygienic. During the meal no one checked back. The chips (both types) were over cooked and the steak had obviously been sat a while as the side on the hot plate was starting to go black (burnt) once cleared we asked for the bill normally we‚Äôd go for desserts but just very unimpressed. The table next to us had already asked for the bill so they asked again when we did. We recieved the bill to be told that the card machine had broken so cash only. We were lucky we had enough as no comment was made about what could be done if we didn‚Äôt and given everything from the last two years I would assume a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt have cash on the them.  Overall wouldn‚Äôt bother with this one the one near Leicester Square is much nicer, in every way.

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"Ordered the burger which came wrapped in foil and nothing else on the plate. As it was wrapped, bread was soggy. For the equivalent of $40 AUD, you would expect your food to be at least plated with some garnish. Had to pay extra for...chips. Credit due is that it was the closest copy of a Macca's burger I've ever had. Can't fault the service but owners/managers were at the next door table! My partner had the steak which at least was put on a plate but came accompanied with 3 cherry tomatoes. Complete rip off. Meant to be a special date night but was a gastronomic flop.

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"Where do I even start ? We‚Äôve come to this place a couple times in the past . It‚Äôs always met our expectations. We was greeted by friendly staff that wasn‚Äôt an issue . But the whole concept of the resturuant has changed . 

The...waiter informed us that the hot stove has been removed due to complaints by other customers about smoke . Seriously ? There‚Äôs so many steak houses in London . What made steak and co unique was the hot stove . The new ownership prioritised a handful of complaints over all the customers that come for the hot stove . If those handful of customers didn‚Äôt like the smoke they should‚Äôve went to another steak house . 

Regardless we stayed and said we‚Äôd try their ‚Äúnew concept‚Äù a try . Menu prices are shocking . ¬£39 for a lobster Mac n cheese and that‚Äôs not a typo . You could get a whole lobster cheaper than that . They‚Äôve removed half of the things that used to be in the menu . E.g. some desserts and sides . Before the butters and seasoning used to included in the steaks now they want to charge for it and it‚Äôs ¬£3.50 . 

We ordered bottles of water one still one sparkling . I was given a very very dirty cup that was not cleaned . I had to point this out to the waiter . 

The food came and it was nothing wow . Definitely not value for money . The chips where bad . The steak wasn‚Äôt of good quality . Could‚Äôve had this in any 2* hotel and it would‚Äôve turned out the same . we won‚Äôt be coming back to this place . New ownership need to rethink what they‚Äôve done as this place used to be packed with customers less than a month ago and now it‚Äôs really empty . Take it on the chin and know you‚Äôve made a mistake and go back on it .

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"I'm embarrassed for tourists visiting this place thinking this is a representation of what London has to offer. Popped in for a quick meal with my daughter for a first time experience. Ordered the burgers which we were both convinced were on the menu at...¬£9. We were served the burger wrapped like a take away in a soggy roll plus had to pay extra for the privilege of chips. When the bill arrived the burgers were actually ¬£19 each !!! We asked to see the menu again & saw how confusing the design was leading to this easy mistake. The staff were sympathetic given this is clearly a head office driven operation & the manager gave us a 25% discount which was an appreciated gesture. However we left the restaurant feeling totally & utterly ripped off. Places like this simply do not deserve to succeed

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"If you like steak, then you‚Äôll enjoy a juicy cut delivered on a hot stone plate for you to cook to taste.  There is a lower-price lunch offer of juicy Argentinian sirloin served with fries, salad and chimicurri sauce. 

Service. Friendly, prompt and courteous. I...was served by Agnieszka, who was quick, helpful and answered my questions about the menu. 

Ambience and style. A spacious dining hall with large windows, letting in lots of afternoon light. Solid, well-spaced tables, so you won‚Äôt be distracted by neighbouring conversations. I visited at a quieter time between lunch and dinner. A cheerful and welcoming place to eat.

Recipes of my travels food review

796952629

Popped into the Steak and Co, Gloucester Rd, Kensington Saturday night, the 10th June.
My Son and I were visiting London for the weekend to join in the atmosphere for the...Euro Final.

It was really busy, but was still well organised and all Covid rules adhered to.

The Staff were polite and Courteous.

We were shown to our seats and after having a few moments to study the menu ( which was uncomplicated but still full of amazing looking dishes ) we were served by a lovely young lady called Ledina who was polite and very knowledgeable of the menu, including the dishes that my son and I asked for.

We both opted for their famous Argentinian Fillet Steak, accompanied with selection of butters, salts and sauces and served to us flash pan seared On a hot plate which we could slice, then leave to cook to our own preference, which is an amazing cooking experience. 

With a side of fries and deep fried fine green beans that had been breaded and coated in Cajun seasoning ( first time I‚Äôve tried these but will definitely try cooking them myself, they were that good ) and two pints of shandy and water, the bill was perfectly reasonable.

Next time I‚Äôm in London I will definitely be revisiting Steak & Co without a doubt.

And finally once again a final thank you to Ledina who is a credit to your company.

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"I‚Äôve been eating here fairly regularly. Service is outstanding (particularly Francesco) and the quality of food is great but the rebranding could be a huge mistake! Hugely disappointed to find out after we were seated last weekend that the hot stones had gone. The menu...was replaced with a good selection of steaks (pricing questionable) but gone are the salts and butters. 

I was a huge fan of the hot stones and the USP it provided for you which helped keep me coming back.  While the steaks remain good quality you‚Äôve lost that edge against every other good steak house in town. Bring back the hot stones!

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"I will start first with the mention that I been in this place so many times before pandemic happens! I love argentinian steak and I cooked sometimes home when lockdown happens. When I cooked home I was always remembered the times when me and my...friends use to go to Steak and Co House and to enjoy so much the quality of the foods and to get what we was expecting and what we was paying for.
Today I had a very bad experience on the lunchtime when I ordered my favourite fillet steak ( as usual ) and I felt something is not right after my food was served. 
The size of the steak was too big, the colour on the outside got me confused too but I didn't want to believe that something feels wrong.
I started to cook the meat on the hot stone and when I cut the steak and I saw the colour I was like : What is this? The colour of the meat was light pink, literally like pork meat, not red not even light red! 
And i was terrified when I tasted and was bitter! 
Immediately I said what's wrong with my meat, the waitress was very nice and she said that she will speak with the manager and let them know about my complaint.
The manager come and said that I will get a new steak and a new hot stone and they are sorry about any inconvenience.
Guys I am very serious when I say that they give for the second time same piece of meat! I don't wanted to call it steak, that piece of meat was never a steak.
The manager come again and ask me why I am complaining again about the meat ? 
And I said: I know how an argentinian steak looks like; I know the colour, the texture, the taste! My mom worked as a chef and I know exactly to make the difference between meats and not only! 
They didn't want to recognise that that piece of meat was not an argentinian steak and They wanted to give me an email address to complain about! 
I said: I don't want to do that, this is not what I came for! I want to come back in this place and eat a real argentinian steak! I want them to don't lie and trick nobody about the meat quality! 
After that they offer me to don't pay for nothing but I am fair and I didn't want anything for free! I still payed for my fries and for my drink! 
I am so disappointed that good places are trying to trick people about the meat they're selling now! 
I know pandemic affected everybody's business but let's stop fooling people about foods quality we're paying for!

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"We stayed in the area overnight and decided to try this restaurant for the first time. 
Atmosphere was nice and the waitress was welcoming and friendly. 
We both ordered steak on the hot rock, Chips and onions rings. 
Food came out smelling lovely. 
Unfortunately though...when I was cutting my steak and put it on my plate along with my chips I noticed a black hair within my steak. 
I immediately stopped eating and called the waitress over‚Ä¶.who offered to cook me another steak but I declined as this put me right off my food. 
Sadly my husband sat there eating alone‚Ä¶ they did refund the cost of my steak but the whole experience was ruined and we still had to pay ¬£70! 
Needless to say we won‚Äôt be going back‚Ä¶..what a shame!

Steak And Company Gloucester Road,"We had originally booked our table for 6:30pm, but we arrived at 6:15 and with tables free we were seated early with no issue. Having been to the restaurant before we were familiar with how the steak was cooked on hot stones, all part of...the appeal and experience. Our server Ledina was without fault, and we later found out it was her first day on the job, so special mention must be made for her. Between the two of us the night came to ¬£120 for 3 courses and a cocktail each, which for the evening we both feel was great value for money. Will definitely be visiting again!

"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"We made our first ever visit to this gem of a restaurant last Friday having read fabulous reviews on our local neighbourhood website.

I dont really want to say how superb this place is as I want to be able to get a table in...the future, however the family who run it deserve all the success for the love and care they have put into starting this restaurant 2 months ago.

The small parade of shops it is situated in has never ever had anything of note there and is the last place you'd expect to find a fine dining restaurant. Well the food is fine dining standard but the place is really relaxed.

From the moment you step inside the aroma of freshly baked bread mixed with the wonderful cooking smells sets you taste buds jumping as did the warm and welcoming smiles of the staff.

The interior d√©cor is luxurious yet homely, you would never know you were in Oakwood.

Complimentary Sicilian Flatbread, home baked Italian Breads, Olives and peppers are bought to the table.

We sat opposite the open kitchen and the sights that were coming out were so mouthwatering. The special was a humungous plate of 2 lobsters with home made pasta and covered with a luscious looking sauce. The smell was amazing. We were told that this was one of the specials that day (¬£29) which I think is amazing value for the portion size.

None of our party of 4 went for that however my friend asked for something off menu replacing the lobsters with seafood, and extra chilli, it looked and tasted wonderful.

The menu which you can find on their website is not very extensive but for me its a good sign of what's to come.

The chef/owner has worked in several Michelin star kitchens around the world and he and his small brigade work effortlessly in preparing the dishes.

We had 4 starters 4 mains, every dish looked and tasted divine, my lamb fillet comprised of 2 pieces of lamb fillet and two cutlets, the meat melted in my mouth.

I've been trying to analyse if I was just getting carried away as for 18 months we've been locked away not going out and only recently started eating out once more.

But no, this place is the real deal, not many tables so I'd advise to book but please leave room for me.

Going to take my vast family there in a week or so, cant wait to go back!!!!
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"We were greeted warmly which is always a good start.  As a group of 7 we were worried that 1 of us would be out on the end of the table but they had seated us as 4 opposite 3 which made conversation and the...feel of the table much nicer.  The service was attentive without being over powering and the atmosphere in the restaurant was buzzy without being mobbed and frantic.  We could easily hear ourselves and each other without being concerned that other diners could hear us too.

The menu is not too large which suits me; I'd rather a chef does a few dishes exceptionally well that offers a wide variety of mediocre dishes.  And the chef here is marvellous; his Sicilian Caponata is delicious!! 

We had a variety of pasta, lamb, fish and vegetable dishes and everyone was really happy with their choice; Chef had some truffle to entice us with too.

This was my third or fourth visit and I will certainly be back.
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"Was here with a group of friends on Friday. We had a lovely time! Staff were accommodating and knowledgeable showcasing their amazing fresh produce! The Chef came to table and was able to put together a fantastic selection of vegetable starters based on our discussions....They were accommodating of individual vegetarian requests and the seafood was divine! Worth the tube journey for anyone around North London for a special family meal or for catching up with old friends!
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"The service was extremely slow - 90 mins just to get a starter.  Specials have no price and be careful not to get stung when the bill comes.

Owner and his wife are rude and condesending - unfortunately when customer service is required to encourage...people to return, they haven't mastered this...won't be returning and will definitely not recommend to try.  There are better places, especially locally where staff and owners appreciate customers and are more than happy to help.

West End prices for a local average restaurant.
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"So after looking online for a vegan restaurant near me, Lizzie‚Äôs cucina came up as it said it caters to vegans. I really don‚Äôt think they understand what vegan means. After just sitting down before even the menus were given a waitress brought over the...‚Äúspecials,‚Äù a plate of different cuts of meat. I was told the chef would come over and tell me some vegan options, but alas he never came. 
Next, on the menu, every item that would constitute a meal had animal products in them. I ordered a risotto without the cheese and made sure to ask that it was vegan, to which the waitress gave me a bit of a blank look and giggled a little. The risotto was not great, the rice was long grain rice and not even an arborio/risotto rice. At least the roasted vegetables were roasted. 
Overall, a very mediocre and overpriced meal which failed to cater to the needs they said they would. If like me you are a conscientious vegan looking for a place to eat, don‚Äôt be deceived by what is written online by them and I‚Äôd look wider afield for an actual vegan meal. 
My advice to Lizzie‚Äôs cucina, actually look up what constitutes a vegan meal, and check what your diners‚Äô preferences are primarily, as after all you advertised yourself as catering to vegans. 
Not very impressed and would be very reluctant to return.
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"Too often restaurants are mediocre and forgettable, not this one.  We had a wonderful meal, we loved every course. The dishes were delicious and it was great that the chef came into the restaurant to talk to  the diners. Everyone was friendly and the place...was buzzing. Highly recommend and hope to return soon
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"This is a real little gem of a place near Oakwood tube station, hiding amongst a very basic looking row of shops. We had such a warm welcome from all the staff (including the chefs who you can see hard at work through an open...hatch) and the service and attention to detail throughout our meal was second to none. The food was absolutely delicious. Really fresh, really tasty and proper Italian - we are so full and so happy - thank you Lizzie's!
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"What a pleasant surprise. Lovely garden out the back. Excellent service , excellent food.

Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"Absolutely amazing menu with food carefully sourced and fresh. Best Italian food I have eaten in this country.  We had a selection of starters to share- asparagus in truffle oil  with grilled with loads of parmesan, huge prawns and some kind of tomato dish. The...mains were excellent  I had raghu slow cooked with lamb though was tempted by the wild boar dish on the menu. My friends had scallops and rib eye steak, all were gastronomic delights. The wines that the waiter recommended to us and we tasted were both excellent and I would not have cared which one got the vote. Service fabulous especially young Lizzie. See you all gain very soon and thank you for a great eve.

Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"We had Sunday lunch here, not a roast but delicious, authentically Italian food. Great, friendly service.

The...pre meal nibbles (on the house) were really high quality too, with a lovely mushroom butter with the home made focaccia.
"
Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"The food was so authentic. The best Italian food we‚Äôve had in the UK. Being vegetarian the Chef specifically made me a homemade pasta dish with tomato, aubergine, capers and mozzarella but he offered me many different options. The burnt aubergine with burrata and black...truffle starter was so good and reminded me of previous travels in Tuscany. A very surprising find in the suburbs of London. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Lizzie's Cucina - Italian Restaurant,"Went for family lunch on my birthday, a Saturday. Had heard it was good through word of mouth, and was not disappointed. 
We all had different dishes (fish, lamb, steak, veg risotto), each was excellent. Clearly high quality ingredients and everything made freshly. Remarkable for...such a small kitchen. Great service too.
Particularly liked the little touches (olives etc etc).
The owners were front of house and chef - obviously work hard and care about the experience of their customers.

The Park Room,"Meeting up with my first girlfriend after losing contact 45 years ago, it was only right and fitting for us to celebrate in style.
Thus, we chose to have afternoon tea in the Park Room at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London on Friday 20th...May 2022.
To say it was the perfect location is an understatement - the ambience, accompanied by the superb pianist playing a selection of beautiful music made the occasion very special.
However, the best part was the beautiful and attentive Saabira who looked after us from the moment we were seated until we departed some hours later.
Her courteous, smiling, wonderful approach to fulfilling her part in presenting the various tasty morsels accompanied by a lovely Rose Petal tea, went to complete a very emotional, happy and joyous reconnection.
Thank you Saabira - you're one in a million!!
"
The Park Room,"Having previously visited The Park Room for afternoon tea a number of times it was great to be back again. 

The staff are very friendly and provided a warm welcome. We were looked after by a lovely young lady who was very attentive and looked...after us perfectly.

The Park Room is a beautiful setting with a pianist playing in the background.

The food is excellent with a wide selection of sandwiches, freshly baked scones, and cakes. If you require more sandwiches, tea, or cakes then they will happily refill your cups/plates at no additional charge.

You are also offered a slice of cake to take home with you  which is a nice touch (the chocolate cake is delicious).

We opted for the champagne afternoon tea which comes with a glass of champagne each however we did top these up with a few more bottles (additional charge).

Thank you again for a lovely Saturday afternoon and I look forward to returning soon. Keep up the good work!
"
The Park Room,"6 of use were coming to London to surprise my wife with afternoon tea for her birthday. We were not disappointed in anyway. The restaurant area was light and inviting, with each table having plenty of space around it so that you felt you were...in your own area rather than just another table. There was a piano being played in the room for background music, which was just right for being able to be enjoyed without interfering with our conversations. The service was impeccable and could not be faulted. My wife is allergic to Strawberries, so they made her her own ""tower"" of sandwiches and cakes just to make sure there was no contamination and the sandwiches were lovely. The food kept coming and we all enjoyed the experience immensely. We all had our own pots of tea and the choice of teas available is extensive! I honestly thought we'd be done within an hour, but we ended up staying for nearly 3 hours in the end. Regrettably for us, we were so full after all the sandwiches and cakes on the plate-towers brought to the tables that we didn't  have enough room for any of the luxurious cakes on the main cake table, although we did try! They are very rich and filling though! Thankfully, they kindly gave us a cake each to take away, so we enjoyed them later! Having afternoon Tea in the Park Room was such an enjoyable way to start our day in London. Thank you to all the staff who made the day so good, and especially to Saiful who made sure we were always happy.  The experience wasn't cheap, but no point did we feel we didn't get value for money; we will definitely be back again.

The Park Room,"Went here during Christmas 2021, and I almost forgot to write the review, but here we are!
The whole experience was absolutely lovely! The employees and the ambience really set the mood and made our stay great. 
The room is gorgeous, and there`s piano music...in the background, not to loud, just the perfect volume.
The room and the service was really high-end and exclusive.
Altay was just wonderful! He was attentive, funny, warm, welcoming and just pure joy! We loved having him attend to our table. 
We had loads of tea to choose from. I sadly picked a not-so-good one. They happily changed it for me and recommended another one, which was tasty. The presentation of the food was lovely, everything looked great! The scones were good, but a bit too dry. We had a lot of jams to choose from, and some of them tasted good, some were too sugary. They even had vegan clotted cream. The vegan sandwiches tasted nice, but were lacking sufficient seasoning. Two of the vegan pastrys/cakes were divine! Fresh, and fruity and not heavy at all. The last two I couldn`t finish. They were dry, lacked of flavour and were chocolatey with a fruity exterior. Not my favourite blend, but other might like a mix of chocolate and berries/fruit. So sadly, not a full score on the food.
There`s only one negative thing to write about and that`s regarding the other guests. This has absolutely not affected my review or my full experience of the Park Room, I just have to write something about it.
Some of the other guests were so incredible rude to the employees and lacked so much respect for them and their work. It was shocking and disgusting to witness. They treated the establishment like a quick service caf√® or fast food joint. Employees at these other establishments deserves to be treated with kindness and respect as well, so they probably treat everyone in the service industry the same, maybe som worse than others.
Some guests took it upon themselves to be seated, even though they were repeatedly told to wait their turn. They rearranged the tables and chairs to their liking, even though they were told not to, and that they would be accommodated as soon as someone was available to help them. They snapped their fingers and nagged about not receiving any tea, pronto! They did not understand that it takes a couple of minutes to get to them, and that it is a five star hotel, where nothing is rushed. (Don`t want to sound prejudiced, but some of the worst guests seemed to be rather posh and ""from money"").
I felt that the employees did everything they could and tried to accomodate everyone, one at a time, but that was not good enough for some of the other guests. 
Please people, when visiting, (any kind or form of establishments) treat the employees with the respect you yourself want to be treated with. Have some patience and be kind. They`re just trying to do their job, and remember that they have their own rules and guidelines to follow. I hope I never get to witness this entitlement ever again.
"
The Park Room,"I took my Mum here as a birthday present, and it exceeded all my expectations! The waiters were extremely attentive and would always ask if we needed anything else. Siri was great and explained the whole experience to us and went over the menu so...we knew exactly what we were getting which was really nice. 
We both had the vegan afternoon tea and it was so good! The menu had the perfect balance of sweet and savoury and the sandwich combinations were lovely, it can be difficult to find a good and  suitable vegan afternoon tea but it was just perfect here! 
Going around Christmas time just added an even more beautiful atmosphere but would 100% recommend to go at any time of the year. Yes, it is on the pricier side however I think you get what you pay for!

And the price was very competitive, especially with the level of service and quality of presentation, food, and tea.

We were told that all the afternoon tea slots...were fully booked but one gentleman accommodated us to order food from the all day menu. Which had plenty of variety of food to chose from and it had Halal food (chicken and beef sandwiches) which is hard to find in some places. The whole experience was very relaxing, the live piano made the ambiance so lovely and on top we had a lovely professional waitress Saabira who took care of us and listened to all our needs. Great job and of course I‚Äôll be going there again perhaps I‚Äôll book a high tea in advance. üòä

High quality & quantity, a big selection of sandwiches, cakes and tea, direct view of the hyde park, and beautiful abiance given the live piano music (pianist even passed by to ask if we...have any song preference! Wow!)

The Park Room,"As part of a personal day of pampering for myself, I enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea at The Park Room. I was running late for my reservation time, but when I called the host was very accommodating and held my table for an extra 10...minutes so I had time to make it. The room had a wonderful ambiance and the live piano music was fabulous. My server, Herlyn, was incredibly attentive throughout my time there, taking the time the explain everything to me and easily adjusting the items for things I couldn't eat. I was so full by the end that I couldn't eat the slice of cake that comes out last, but Herlyn very kindly packed that up, along with a couple of the other pastries I had left to take with me.

The Park Room,"This was a really lovely experience; a delayed present from the family.  The afternoon tea was beautifully presented and very tasty and included a glass of champagne which made the occasion really special.  The service was impeccable and our waitress, Valentina, was so helpful and...attentive.  The atmosphere was very good and a piano playing in the background added to the ambiance.  All in all a memorable experience which we would highly recommend.

The Park Room,"We went as a family of 6 for an afternoon tea experience on Wednesday 20th October. We had an absolutely wonderful experience & we‚Äôre very well looked after. Our hostess Cristina assured us nothing was too much trouble & we enjoyed a wide selection of...teas, sandwiches, scones & pastries.
We were all vegetarian with 4 of us not eating eggs either. Some of the items did come containing egg but after a very short wait we received alternative egg free pastries & scones.
From the start to finish we enjoyed wonderful, friendly service, even packing items which we could not complete at the time.
We were not rushed at all & had plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere of the beautiful room & melodious live piano music provided by Igor, resident musician. Igor‚Äôs selection of music added an extra layer of joy to the experience, playing easily recognisable songs & allowing us to interact with him during our visit.
Our guests were from the USA & both they & we truly felt well looked after throughout the afternoon.
I would highly recommend this as a lovely afternoon tea experience.  Thanks Cristina, Igor & all.

The Park Room,"I have sampled many afternoon teas in my time but overall for food quality, service, setting and ambience this was the best. Our service from Siri was perfect, she was welcoming, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We were offered a choice of two...tables, my husband was given alternative vegetarian sandwiches specific to his dietary requirements (he particularly liked the mushroom, thank you chef. The flavours of the sandwiches, preserves and cakes were beautifully subtle and we were asked if we would like more sandwiches and scones which was a nice touch. The pastries were exquisite in both taste and appearance.  There was an array of tea options and help was on hand from the staff as to what to choose and we could have sampled different teas had we wished two.  I loved the Dong Ding blend and enjoyed four pots of this tea during the afternoon!  The ambience was light airy and peaceful, friendly and relaxed with a pianist in the background. A truly fabulous afternoon tea.
"
The Park Room,"Celebrated my wife's birthday and Valentines day here today and it could not have been better. Everything was first class. 

Firstly, there is so much food. From the refreshing palate cleansing Amuse-bouche, to the yummy finger sandwiches, to the delicious open sandwiches (these were so...good), to the buttermilk scones (these might be the best out of all the Afternoon Teas we have been to) with Devonshire clotted cream and your choice of jam, to the delectable pastries and to round it all off you get to choose a home baked cake at the end. 

Secondly, the amazing and kind service and hospitality shown today by Siri was utterly exemplary. She knew exactly when to come round to ask whether we wanted more food or tea, and whether everything was ok and when to just give us space to enjoy the afternoon tea. Siri was superb.

Thirdly, when making the reservation i noted that it was for my wife's birthday and at the end of the meal, Siri kindly brought a dessert plate for my wife and had the pianist play happy birthday for her. This was greatly appreciated.

Fourthly, any food that you can't finish ,except for the sandwiches, the staff will gladly box for you to take home. And when I say box, i mean neatly packed and packaged into plastic containers first before placing them in a takeaway box. This was a classy move and shows they really do care about the level of service that they are providing.

Launceston Place manages to deliver very high quality on all three fronts; the ambiance is warm and inviting, and surroundings are incredibly pretty,...while the quality of the food and beverages is impeccable and full of surprises, and the team of waiters and sommeliers put on a show full of enthusiasm and total commitment to the customer experience. This establishment lingers on your pallet and sings in your mind and heart for days after. This is great because it's pricey, appropriate for special occasions for the average wallet - and so well worth it! (We went for the Christmas Eve Festive Tasting Menu; this may become a tradition in this family; it was that spectacular!) I will be back soon! I may try lunch next time. Impressed!

Launceston Place,"Went to Launceston Place for my birthday lunch with 5 close friends.  Was an incredibly memorable experience.  We chose the tasting menu which was just fabulous and the wine selection suggested was very complimentary.  Service was excellent but not intrusive.  All the courses where inventive,...clever and  very enjoyable. 

At ¬£67 for the tasting menu it was outstanding value which we chose to compliment with some amazing wines. 

Highly recommend and will return before Xmas.

Launceston Place,"This restaurant is near Gloucester Road in London. It is beautifully and tastefully decorated. The food is excellently presented and is akin to dining in a Michelin star restaurant at a fraction of the prices. The food is more like nouvelle cuisine in presentation and...size but I was left pleasantly full at the end of their Sunday lunch. The wine list is small but well chosen. The service is friendly and the waiters and waitresses are knowledgeable and helpful without being intrusive. There are also disabled friendly toilets, which is good. This is a restaurant to take a special trip to visit if you are in London and is one to which I will return.

Launceston Place,"As food writer I rarely use this platform to provide reviews, however I was asked and felt compelled as I received such an exemplary experience. 
I had been meaning to visit for some time and finally made it to this lovely Kensington restaurant with talented...chef Ben Murphy at its helm and Ian Toogood, General Manager. Elegantly decorated with light flooding in through its beautiful windows, one feels calm immediately. 

I was looked after by several of the team who assured me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to take care of you‚Äù and take care of me they did. What a meal. Wanting to try several dishes, I opted for the tasting menu inspired by Ben‚Äôs grandmother Phyllis. The beef tartare taco prepared me for the high standard I was to receive throughout. I am a truffle fiend and so was delighted that they featured heavily. Highlights were the lamb belly, tiger prawn, mushroom yolk, turbot and a plethora of desserts. Koffmann‚Äôs souffl√© was always going to be a winner with me. 

Afterwards I spent some time with Ben and the team. Hard-working and passionate, he is an inspirational leader with a very hands on attitude. This enthusiasm is positively absorbed in his colleagues whom are clearly proud to work with him. 

Ian‚Äôs front of house are superb. They advise and recommend when asked, then leave you to throughly enjoy your meal, always on hand to make recommendations. Nothing is too much trouble.

Thank you to all of you for making this such a lovely lunch. I was spoilt rotten and will definitely return as Ben has assured me there are many more dishes to try. Just waiting for that star now!

Launceston Place,"Our table was booked for 6 pm, we arrived at 5:35 pm and were treated with disscontempt. We were shown to a table and ordered our meal. at no point did anyone mention anything regarding track and trace. 

The menu is hard to interpret with...us and several of the tables close by having to ask the maitre d‚Äô what certain items consisted of. 

Maitre d‚Äô then asked us to keep the noise down and because we didn‚Äôt lower our laughing to what he felt was an acceptable level he then refused to serve us any more drinks and was very rude, abrupt and quite frankly it ended our night on a terrible tone. 

Quite frankly I would not recommend this restaurant and i I would say that I have never been treated that badly in a restaurant before.

I would like also to comment that the tables are not spaced 2m apart, not one member of staff asked if we were in the same household and they have no track and trace system in place.

Launceston Place,"The food is just great, worthy of a Michelin star if you believe me. Prices are affordable (maybe that would change with a Michelin star‚Ä¶). Sadly the service is ¬´¬†over the top¬†¬ª . For one thing the manager should ban his staff from telling customers...to ¬´¬†enjoy¬†¬ª : it‚Äôs bad form and it has the exact opposite effect to the one it purports to achieve : all of a sudden, one feels depressed. Staff should make themselves invisible rather than come and ask customers whether they liked what they eated : just leave them alone!

We visited Launceston Place for lunch in May for the second time in three years, the previous was for dinner in their private dining room and absolutely nothing disappointed. The food is sublime and presented as art...on a plate being equally complimented by outstanding, attentive but not overbearing service. You may feel this is a rather over-the-top review but I truly thought it was a memorable experience and one I believe you‚Äôll enjoy trying. Thanks to Ben Murphy and his team, we‚Äôve already re-booked our next visit.

Launceston Place,"This restaurant serves only three choices of each course. It had nothing on the menu other than slowly cooked meats  (requiring hours of cooking) or precooked courses which were only heated up before being served. My main course with mushrooms had so much salt that...I could not taste anything else in it. The Appetiser was a precooked tiny pastry with not much taste. Pretentious, expensive and horribly tasting  precooked (and heated up) food.

Launceston Place,"Instagrammable dishes have become omnipresent! With the iPhone becoming an amuse bouche for courses at certain restaurants, it seems many restaurants are seeking form over function. Function being joyous and playful dishes. Form being social media postable‚Ä¶.

Launceston Place offers up a tasting menu with...those delightful dishes in mind. Whilst photogenic indeed, Chef Ben Murphy has harked back to childhood and brought together superior flavours with all the nostalgia and freedom of youth.  An array of courses that complement the last, almost as if you‚Äôre hitting your teens by course 4 and - by dessert wine - it‚Äôs back outdoors to adulthood again.

I relished my experience at Launceston Place. Service was tight without being overbearing and a sensible wine choice from our waiter made our dinner flow. A diners delight and a chance to relive some forgotten memories of simpler times.

My boyfriend and I have never experienced fine dining before but this certainly...won‚Äôt be our last time. The food was delicious and presented so beautifully. We were pleasantly surprised to receive additional foods to taste in between courses as well. 

At the time of confirming my booking, I was asked if it was for an occasion and did mention it was for my partner‚Äôs birthday - I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything - but it was a lovely gesture to receive a ‚ÄòHappy Birthday‚Äô note and little cake at the end of our meal. We really enjoyed ourselves.

Tania's of Hampstead,"I‚Äôm someone that never writes reviews but I feel I had to share my amazing experience with you all. I stumbled across this little gem of a place off the high street. The coffee is the best I‚Äôve had, (I love my coffee) made with...genuine love and care. I then ordered a waffle which was surprisingly light and flavoursome (Nutella, cream & strawberries) 

The owner is a very friendly guy who let me try some sun dried figs which I thought would be hard and tasteless but the complete opposite. Very sweet and a healthy alternative to sugary sweets. I took a box home. I also ordered something called ‚ÄúMiracle Juice‚Äù (with a name like that I had to buy a bottle) wow an interesting taste and you can feel the goodness going into your body. I ordered a few bottles to take away. 

There‚Äôs so much more to try and will be back next week and going to make it my regular place to frequent. 

Go try it you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

"
Tania's of Hampstead,"We stumbled upon Tania's one cloudy morning, drawn in by the sign saying ""healthy food"".  What followed was an experience that we plan to repeat as many times as possible. Unsure of what we wanted for breakfast, Ghassan/the owner guided us through the most pleasurable...and memorable meals we have had in a long time. It was wonderful to be told the journey and history of each food item we delighted in eating and we savored every minute of it.

"
Tania's of Hampstead,"We had the most unbelievable experience at Tania's. We were greeted by Ghassan who went above and beyond and showed us the most amazing warmth and customer service. As first-timers, he invited us in to sample his homemade chocolate (delicious) and even gave us free...espresso! I bought some tea and he adorably printed my name on it with complimentary descriptive adjectives. The venue is tiny and adorable, in a magical, tucked away location near the High Street. I have lived in London for years and this has been my favorite find in a long time!! I will be frequenting this place from now on! 5 stars!!!!
"
Tania's of Hampstead,"My daughter and I spotted the sign Tania's cafe down a inviting cobblestone antiques alley, and took a tentative few steps in.  The owner of the cafe welcomed us warmly.  We had a grilled cheese sandwich (delicious) and a falafel wrap (also delicious).  As we...ate, it dawned on us the cafe was something special. The owner, who reminds me of my favourite uncle, showed us his range of homemade biscuits.  His shop is jammed packed with unusual things, like pistachio paste (home made), fresh peppercorns from Burma, home made dark chocolate, all of which he made us try!  I came away with a jar of pistacho paste, a bag of home-blended decaf earl grey.  The owner used to be a chef, he noticed what my daughter liked and did not like (she picked out the peppers from the sandwich), he told us of his products with pride and had many more things to show us but we had to meet someone.  This is an Aladdin's cave, in a quiet interesting secret alley right in the heart of the Village.  Even better, Tania's Cafe is participating in the Eat Out to Help Out offer.  You get got ¬£10 off a spend of ¬£20 or more! I will come back soon with my husband and friends.
"
Tania's of Hampstead,"Great little place! Not much room but sooo cozy. We weren‚Äôt even going for a coffee but we got invited to tasted some homemade chocolate and then we ended up staying for an hour. When we walked out we had tried a lot more than...the chocolate. Delicious cookies, many different kind of tea and nice coffee. While sitting there we had some sweet conversation with both the owner and the people who came in for a coffee and and a chat. 
This is a must do if you‚Äôre in the neighbourhood..

"
Tania's of Hampstead,"This slightly hidden off track delicatessen was a real treat to find!

The owner was extremely friendly and inviting and gave me a mini feast of things to try!

Everything I tried was very tasty.

I ended up buying mulled  wine teaÔøº Leaves, Iranian Sun...dried figs (amazing)Ôøº Rose buds to add to tea (smell absolutely divineÔøº). I also tried the pistachio nut butter which was delicious and I would go back to buy!

The ruby chocolate shavings and dark chocolate shavings I tried were also yummyÔøº!

The owner even made a sweet label for my Tea with my name on it! A Very sweet touchÔøº :)

Tania's of Hampstead,"A tiny cafe & delicatessen tucked in between the antique shops in the Antique Emporium, a tiny side street off Heath Street in the middle of Hampstead. Had a homemade felafel wrap which was delicious and reasonably priced. Owner falling over himself to be friendly,...and gave me a free expresso at the end. Apart from the eats & drinks the shop is floor to ceiling with specialist olive oils, teas & coffees, honeys etc, They also do their own homemade chocolate - I bought a bar of 80% dark - ¬£3 and very tasty. Well worth a visit.

Tania's of Hampstead,"My friend and I were looking for a coffee place in Hamsted Heath and we went down a beautiful cobble paved side street to find Tania's of Hampstead where we were introduced to taste many fine, luxury food items from around the world all having...great aroma and flavour! We enjoyed one of the speciality teas (recommend the mulled wine tea), pistachio pesto olive oil, chocolate and cream waffle. 5* customer service from the owner himself. He made me and my friend feel like princesses and even included our names and a thank you note on our purchase of the teas after. Exactly what we needed after not being out for so long during 2020/2021. Thank you so much for the kind service and great food and drink, we will be back many times.

Tania's of Hampstead,"Tania's of Hampstead is such a unique and welcoming spot in Hampstead. Ghassan welcomed us in to his family shop and cafe, with more warmth than I've experienced in London in a long time. He gave us so many delicious things to try, and everything...was truly delicious! From the crispy spinach filled pastry, creamy pistachio pesto, to the sweetest dried figs. We left the place smiling from ear to ear.

Bruce Burgers,"Four of us, including one fussy eater, enjoyed our meal immensely.

We ordered too much as there was too much choice and we wanted to taste as many things as possible. Wise move add everything was delicious.

There is a hint of scotch bonnet chilli...on most items. One of us is allergic to chilli and the really lovely waitress helped us order foods with and without the chilli. If this is a thing for you it's worth calling ahead as we had the last few burgers made with no chilli.

Everything was yum. Everything got five stars. Miss fussy eater even gave her food five stars.

It's a small place and daytime parking might be an issue but it fully deserves all the praise it's received on trip advisor.

The jerk bbq chicken burger was fantastic and full of flavour. Also you have a wide range options...of chips such as sweet potatoe fries, curly fries and chunky fries.

Bruce Burgers,"I visited the restaurant on Thursday 6 August and was very impressed. Everything was Covid-19 compliant, and the food was terrific. Good portions, and the menu is very well thought out. It's a bit like Gourmet Burger Co and Five Guys, but instead of paying...a premium for a chain restaurant, everything at Bruce Burgers is freshly prepared and feels just like how a small business should be - warm, friendly and done with love. And wait until you try the cheesecake!

Upon...arrival we received a very warm welcome and were showed a seat. The menu was so exciting, there was so many things we wanted to try. (We‚Äôll defo be going back)I ordered a Bruce burger (obviously) with all the toppings, with curly fries, a portion of plantain and a portion of wings. My girlfriend order a beef wrap, curly fries and haloumi fries. Please believe when I tell you this meal was delightful. Everything we ordered was amazing, my burger was perfect, the wings were finger-licking, the haloumi fries were delicious and the plantain was yummy, and my girlfriend loved the wrap.
I feel everyone shouldn‚Äôt take my word for it, I feel everyone should try pass by and try the food for themselves. I feel there is so many things on the menu I want to try so I may be there when you are there. Thank you Bruce Burgers for introducing me to such lovely food, and you have definitely got a new fan in us.

Bruce Burgers,"Due to travelling to the area for work, I was staying in a nearby hotel and this showed up on my search for evening food.

I ordered a build your own burger with one lamb patty and one beef patty.  To go with it I...also ordered the halloumi.  

The burger was really good; cooked well and still with plenty of juice flowing from it as I bit into it.     The meat was dense and full of flavour.

The halloumi was also really good and had been cooked enough to be really hot and have some chargrilled effect on the outside.  

Definitely recommend!

Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"I was in the London Bridge area with a few hours to kill. So I looked where to lunch. When I saw the sign for this restaurant's saying Pizza I decided to investigate. First I came across the street level take out. However, I went...round the corner and saw a door for the main restaurant. On entering and walking down the stairs, I was greeted by a vibrant and bustling restaurant with diners clearly having a good time. Despite how busy they were, a delightful waitress smiled and showed me to a nice table. My simple 2 course meal with a couple of Peroni beers was delightful. I was sad to leave after having spent 2 hours of being transported back in time to the very best Italian restaurants had to offer in the 1970s. Really looking forward to coming back with friends so we can all go on a sentimental journey.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"Ended up here after the restaurant we had planned to go had a too long of a wait, and very glad we did. The restaurant is entered from a side alley and is easy to miss. You go downstairs and the restaurant is very old...fashioned and world's away from the trendy eateries in the area.

Service was very efficient without us being made to feel hurried despite it being a Friday night. The menu was simple Italian pasta dishes, some meat dishes and pizzas. I had the penne with vegetables and tomato sauce and would definitely order this again. It was absolutely delicious.

Apparently every Friday and Saturday night they have a club night which goes on until 4am! We did not stay for this but sounded intriguing nonetheless! While we were there they had a singer and many groups came to dine. This place has an atmosphere. 

The tables are packed a little tightly but its a small space so this is what you get, and I think the toilets could do with being updated.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"My friends and I went to the restaurant for the first time today and has the most unexpected fun night ! There was a live singer, a girl got the microphone to sing too, everyone sang along and the staff and Manager were so welcoming...and fun ! The food is excellent Italian traditional. You can tell it‚Äôs fresh and that people put their heart in this place to make us have the best time. The restaurant is underground which makes it cozy.
The manager offered many rounds of limoncello and meloncello which I found very kind especially in UK it is rare. You can tell it‚Äôs a real Mediterranean place :) 
Thank you again for the wonderful spirit. Keep the hard work during these difficult times, we will come back !

Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"The place lacks in ambiance, minimal waiter input/waiters are uninterested in their diners. But the worst part of our experience by far was the food itself, the risotto was so salty that it might as well been cooked in seawater and the vegetarian lasagna was...obviously not freshly prepared but merely reheated. It lacked (any) b√©chamel sauce, the vegetables were unrecognisable, the dish was a complete mush with little flavour. Very pricey for basic and frankly disgusting food.

Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"We chose this restaurant as it had some great reviews and their website said they have GF options. Unfortunately they informed us once we were there that they dont do any GF options anymore and were not at all apologetic that their website says otherwise...and were very dismissive about it. Food was average only. We wouldn't return.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"Myself and my husband had an absolutely cracking night here. The food was 10/10 (from a very fussy vegetarian)  and the service was absolutely amazing. I couldn‚Äôt recommend a more friendly or welcoming establishment. Glad we stumbled on it during our trip - highly recommend
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"No napkins or wine menu no wine cooler,or compliments

Have been to establishment many times before lockdown but what a change . Staff changes new head waiter has terrible take it or leave it attitude 
Prices are not cheap that they add a high service...charge for non existence service.
What are the owners doing.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"The waitress said that she had to take our starter away because our main was ready, and took our starter off the table before we had finished it. I ordered a vegetarian dish (mushroom ravioli) and was served pasta containing seafood, and the seafood was...rock solid and so flavourless that I didn't even notice until the lady at the table next to me asked what I was eating as she realised I had been served her dish. My friend's risotto was overcooked and incredibly salty. 

As far as I'm concerned, serving seafood to a vegetarian customer is completely unacceptable. They replaced my food when I complained, but didn't understand why I was now uncomfortable eating the replacement.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"My friend Jess and I had hit happy hour hard. We tried to go for tacos and they weren‚Äôt serving anymore. We tried three other places in the market area no such joy for 10pm dinner. We passed the Italian sign and thought Pizza. Yes...they seated us after 10pm and oh my did we eat! The food was delicious, we met the chef and The main man himself G. We chatted about running marathons. Great food, great company and there was even live music and my friend and I danced. 
Never been before and will return again to soak up those margaritas!
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"Booked this for an  early evening dinner after struggling to find availability elsewhere in the area and so glad we did. The food was excellent and there is a good atmosphere. Staff are friendly and efficient. The complimentary limoncello was a nice surprise. I would...never have found it from the street, being tucked away in an alleyway off of Borough High St but I can highly  recommend this restaurant.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"We‚Äôre from the New Haven area of Connecticut, US where there can be definite ‚Äúopinions‚Äù on good pizza. I would come back here again for both the pizza and the lasagna. If you want something different from fish & chips and burgers, try here. Small,...quaint atmosphere‚Ä¶you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"This was perfect for us, a family, looking for a simple, not too expensive, pasta meal near London Bridge. Other places we looked at were either deserted and too bright, or expensive with black-clad door staff, chrome and glass, we'd have ruined the ambience..)
So...the good: the food was lovely, (although my pasta was jeeeeust under. Hopefully the chef had not taken the previous comment about mush (strongly disagree) to heart ). Families take note: no pizza. It's  a basement so probably not practical to have a pizza oven.
Kids portions at half price. Wine selection was good and sensibly priced  (house for about 15, lots of choice around the 25 quid mark).
The not so good: no serviettes, asked twice for second drinks, gents toilets out of order.
Asking for a fruit juice they didn't have caused a minor family row behind the bar which you could say was.. endearing? At least there's some passion there.

Overall, this seems like a gem in a great location, but could do with a spruce up. I'd really hate to see it gentrified though, I'll take the slightly scruffy but yummy over stilted tense service that any day.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"From the moment I booked for my son‚Äôs 18th birthday celebration to the moment we left the restaurant every arrangement and detail was taken care of by Lisa. The food was amazing and atmosphere was festive. A fantastic experience.
"
Giuseppe's Ristorante Italiano,"This is a fantastic authentic Italian restaurant serving delicious food. You enter down a little alley and then go downstairs into an Italian cavern! The service is brilliant. We were made to feel like old friends even though this was our first visit. There was...a singer who just added to the ambience. The food was delicious and great size portions. Afterwards we had a complimentary limoncello and chocolate for our son. Little touches which don‚Äôt cost a lot but mean a lot for the customer. Can‚Äôt recommend this restaurant enough and will definitely go back. Do book though as it‚Äôs not huge so book so you‚Äôre not disappointed! Thanks for such a lovely end to our day!

"
Bebs Kitchen,"Excellent food. Best curries and nan breads I‚Äôve had for along time. The owners are lovely people too
"
Bebs Kitchen,"I arrived at Bebs Kitchen with caution; my friend (all of whom are a little loopy) assured the group it was a worthy trip to the darker parts of SW London. As I entered, the weight of my 7 Grolsch Pilsner‚Äôs that I was able...to bring from my home fridge lessened - and no, I had not drunk any by that point. A warning - bring your own cups, why would you supply cups if you do not supply the tasty alcoholic liquid that goes inside. This is a lesson all restaurants could learn from, well done Beb. 

We ordered what can only be described as an obscene amount of Indian food for a Thursday night. Our lovely host, Beb‚Äôs wife, instantly cautioned us on our quantities; ‚Äòyou can take it away if you don‚Äôt eat it all‚Äô. A trader in the city of london she would not make, but a trustworthy smiley face she will win 100 times over. The food arrived, poppadoms to Bhaji‚Äôs to Bhunas, Kormas, Butters and Madras. 7 empty stomachs turned full, full of Beb‚Äôs delicious cooking. 

As we all began to slump, weighty with food and drink, the most astounding pick me up arrived behind the counter. Beb, hairnet and all, tests his microphone. ‚ÄòWhat is this?‚Äô We ask, a silly question. Chef turned performer, raises us all from our seats in a whirlwind of 80s, 90s and noughties delights. The poor passers by in the bus stop (travel convenience) outside, wonder if they should have spent their Thursday not at home, but at Beb‚Äôs Kitchen. 

A ¬£5.49 bottle of Peach Schnapps from the conveniently placed Lidl over the road ensured that ‚ÄòSweet Caroline‚Äô was sung with more fervour than one cares to remember. 

I am sorry for my prejudgement, Beb. I will return soon, bringing more friends and more of my own beer.

Thank you.
"
Bebs Kitchen,"We have never had this much fun and amazing food at a restaurant before. A group of 8 of us go on a regular monthly trip to indian restaurants around London and Bebs sits high above the rest in our opinion. It's a humble family...owned restaurant with a lot of character. All of the food we chose was fantastic and high quality with so much to choose from on the menu (with half of us being vegetarian). Come 10pm there was music, dancing and signing, I've never seen so much joy in a restaurant before. Beb and Fernanda really treat their customers like family, it brought a smile to everyone's face and genuine happiness. We will definitely be returning!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"I recently visited with friends for my birthday and it was the best night out we've had in forever. The food is delish and such good value for money, plus a rare byob find in Brixton (though remember to bring your own cups!) The stars...of the show were the hosts & atmosphere. What started as a lively, chatty evening turned into a karaoke session with the whole restaurant getting involved - absolute chaos but utterly hysterical. Bebs & Fernanda you made my birthday and I will be bringing everyone here for the foreseeable!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"Had such an amazing night at Bebs kitchen. The food was really tasty and the atmosphere was amazing. It‚Äôs a small restaurant run by a husband and wife who are so kind and attentive and also great fun- they even got karaoke out at the...end! Such a great vibe, perfect for a birthday party/celebration! Will be returning very soon and telling everyone about it!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"Myself and 14 mates came to eat here for my birthday. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff were so so lovely. They had baked a cake for me and one of the staff members played guitar and encouraged everyone to sing along to...some classic tunes. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday celebration thanks to Bebs! A birthday I will never forget. Will be recommending Beb's to everyone I know
"
Bebs Kitchen,"Great Curryoke birthday party here, booked for 25 people and Fernanda and Ben did such a good job of providing us with fantastic food and service. Everybody complimented the food and we loved the karaoke, would 100% recommend for the food and the all round...experience. They also catered for all sorts of dietary requirements without any issues, very helpful!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"This homely feel restaurant is a must visit! The hosts are so accommodating it felt like we were long time friends. The restaurant is BYOB and the food was fantastic. The host had a family birthday for a relative in another country. She baked a...cake for the customers to have free of charge after the meal. We were asked if we could record is singing happy birthday for the family relative. Great experience, will definitely be back to support a brilliant local business!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"Good quality food and hospitality run aplenty in this quaint, family run restuarant. Stepping inside it feels as though you're being welcomed home, with an excellent menu and warm pitter patter with the owners. The food was excellent, topped off by a real treat; live...musical performances which provided entertainment for all. Will be back for sure!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"I found this restaurant on Google yesterday as I am not familiar with the Brixton area, and we needed to book something in a hurry.  We were a party of 7 and when we first arrived, I was not sure if we had made the...right choice.  This is not a flashy place at all, but Bebs and Fernanda made us feel very welcome from the start.  

There is an extensive menu catering for carnivores, vegetarians and vegans - the food was excellent but as we soon discovered this is not just a place to eat!  Bebs and Fernanda have perfected the recipe for entertainment too and the magic started to happen when Bebs started singing, then others joined in and the atmosphere was electric.  We were blessed to have another table of some very talented musicians who were dining at the same time.  Words cannot do justice to the amazing time we had.  I have been to many top restaurants in London and other countries but this one is right up there for sheer unadulterated fun as well as its culinary delights.  

I woke up this morning not sure if I had dreamt it all but I have photographic evidence so it must have happened. Will definitely be going back! Love this restaurant.
"
Bebs Kitchen,"Came here with my housemates after having seen the excellent reviews online, booked a table, we were all blown away by both the food and the excellent hospitality. What stars Beb and Fernanda are! We ordered a wide range of both vegetarian and meaty food...(chana massala, saag paneer, vegetable jalfrezi, and a lamb bhuna + rice/naan). The food was delicious, hearty, and good value. 

We ended the evening singing with the everyone in the restaurant, turning what was already a stellar evening into a great one. I truly feel we have made excellent friends at Bebs, and we want to return very soon. 

Absolutely recommend to anyone in Brixton for a wholesome, family friendly, jolly environment with EXCELLENT food. 

Thank you again to everyone at Bebs for a wonderful evening.
"
Bebs Kitchen,"What can I say. I‚Äôd heard great things before booking this for a group of 16 for my 25 birthday but it exceeded all expectations. 

It‚Äôs was truly a night to remember and Beb and the team went out of their way to make it...unforgettable. Don‚Äôt hesitate book now. If you want amazing food mixed with singing and laughter it‚Äôs the place to be. Thank you so much!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"I went to Bebs Kitchen on recommendation, and cannot recommend it highly enough for a delicious takeaway. I ordered the Paneer Shashlik with Pilau Rice - the meal was full of flavour and nutrition and was reasonably priced. It is very clear that the food...is freshly and lovingly made. I had an excellent experience from the moment I ordered, as the lovely owner told me about her life,  and offered me tea and poppadom while I waited. The world could do with being a bit more like Bebs Kitchen and I will be revisiting!
"
Bebs Kitchen,"My sons and I decided to eat at Bebs Kitchen when we visited  my son who lives nearby, what a great decision!

We were made very welcome and started with poppadoms and spices, we decided to try the Goan specialities and had a Paneer dish...which had been made in the Tandoor. We had the Prawn Curry and Xacuti chicken and were helped to get the correct rice to match each dish. THe Nan breads were freshly prepared and delicious.

All the food was great - especially the prawn curry and we were even entertained with live singing. 

We will definitely visit again.

Bebs Kitchen,"Visited the wonderful Beb's last night with my Godson and one of my best friends. I had previously been informed that the food was excellent and great value.

The rose tea served at the end of the meal was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.

Bebs Kitchen,"I live in Brixton and my dad and brother came to visit me and we decided to try Bebs. All three of us couldn't have been happier with our choice to go there.

The only thing that could have improved it was that the waiter declined to provide a smaller portion of pancakes for my 3 year old (or more, they could do a smaller...portion but would have to charge full price because of ‚Äúthe till‚Äù). At nearly ¬£12 this felt a bit steep.

The food when it came was the best we‚Äôve had (though not cheap).

Scarlett Green,"I had high expectations of this place and was very disappointed. 

Unfortunately we were seated next to a group of shreiking rowdy women who drowned the music out and made the experience awful. 

On their website it says they do not take hen party bookings,...yet these ladies were louder than any hen party I've come across. 

No effort was made to ask them to be mindful of others. 

Drinks were poorly presented and tool forever just to order them. 

The service was terrible. Though I did feel very sorry for our waitress as it was not her fault and she did apologise for the terrible service. 

However when we said we were not paying service charge we were asked why, which I found unusual, considering we'd had an apology. 
Why on earth would I pay a ¬£25 tip for terrible service?! 

Main course took over an hour to arrive.

Meat platter was very nicely presented and mostly very good. However the Steak was a bit chewy. 

As we only had a 90 minute slot I asked whilst waiting for our main platters,  if we would still be able to order dessert as we were so looking forward to it and it was not our fault that the meal was taking so long. 

However I was informed by the young male waiter that we had to be out after 90 mins whether finished or not. 

This made us feel rushed and feeling that we only had 20 mins to eat our meat platter. 

Feeling we had no choice but to rush through our meal, was difficult considering it was a large platter. 

And then after all that we were then  offered a desserts menu by our waitress anyway,  after being told previously that we'd need to be out by the male waiter?! 

Not a good customer journey at all. 

Unpleasantly smelly unisex toilets, with a loo seat missing in one. Felt very uncomfortable as toilets were busy. 

I understand that during covid times things are tough, but don't offer customers just a 90 min slot if you've not got the staff. 

Terrible customer experience, good food, nice friendly waitress who's fault it was not as she was only doing her job.
"
Scarlett Green,"Dear Bettie,
 Thank you for visiting Scarlett Green. We are very sorry for the negative experience you encountered. 

Your visit was on the weekend, probably Saturday. This period, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays are the busiest days of trading for us. We are working very hard...
"
Scarlett Green,"I picked this restaurant as it shows as number one in the whole of London out of 17,000 restaurants. It was a special evening for my partners birthday. 
First impression - awful, loud music with a DJ playing in the corner. Like a nightclub. Very...busy with the table next to us 20cm away (not an exaggeration). This is horrendous covid or no covid!! I luckily needed the toilet straight away so I went downstairs past the blood stain on the wall, and into the grubby toilets. The toilet was full of toilet paper and had clearly been blocked for a while. I felt dirty when I came out! 
Anyway downstairs tables seemed more spaced out and had more appropriate background music playing. So I asked to be moved and this was sorted. 
The manger then went on to look after us. After 10 mins one of our drinks arrived and we had to chase up the second one 10 mins later. 
We sat next to the kitchen so could see things being deep fried in baskets and grilled. There didn‚Äôt seem to be much cooking going on as I would expect in such a highly rated restaurant. 
I had the chicken parm which was ok, frozen chicken escalope and melted cheese. This is hard to mess up. My partner ordered a rare steak. Now not many restaurants get this right, but this was the first time he had experienced actual RAW meat. The outside was charred and the inside raw. The grill was on too high and the person ‚Äúcooking‚Äù clearly didn‚Äôt know how to cook a steak which is annoying when it‚Äôs ¬£26! 
On further inspection the 5 star reviews seem to be for the bottomless drinks or certain members of staff. 
The whole experience was just ok. I was so disappointed. My review would have been just one star had it not been for the friendly manager.
"
Scarlett Green,"We found the restaurant to be surprisingly unauthentic to Australia and it's food and culture. The high ranking Trip Advisor listing sadly misled us on this occasion.

Service was mostly poor standard and lacking knowledge of your menu. For example nobody knew if your two...fish dishes were cooked in the oven or on the grill and three members of staff had to check with the chef as nobody came back with a convincing reply.

The meat sharing platter looked disappointing for ¬£60 and the coctail tanks being served looked heavily water-based and over filled with ice.

One member of staff was outstanding however, Clara engaged really well with tables everywhere and was delightful to chat with. Top marks to her.

Scarlett Green,"Dear guest, 

 I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your evening with us  Saturday evening.

"
Scarlett Green,"This was a very disappointing experience, possibly as expections were high for somewhere rated so highly.
  
When we arrived we had booked in advance and had to wait for 5 minutes for one of the waitresses to seat us, it was busy so that's ok...but not excllent.

We were shown to our table which was a small round bistro table.  The tables either side were very close with just enough room to squeeze between to get seated.  Overall it was very cramped, noisy and crowded.

We waited quite a long time before our order was taken for drinks and food, we ordered the sharing meat platter.  They provided water on the table without asking which is a nice touch.  The wait for our drinks and food was not too bad, especially as they were very busy but it was OK at best, certainly noy very good.

The wine I ordered was dull and uninspiring, the cocktail my wife ordered was also somewhat insipid and instantly forgettable.  

On to the food, the waitress delivered a couple of small side plates, the meat platter on a large plate and the side order of chips.  It only just fitted on the table and that was after we moved everything else except our drinks.  

Overall it was not a comfortable, relaxed experience as everything was just too tightly packed in.

With regards to the food, the lamb was a little tough, the steak very small but OK and both cooked well, the sausages were really tasty.  The ribs were very disappointing and quite bland.  The sides (chips) were a bit limp and luke warm.
Getting the bill and paying was efficient and quick.

I've been completely objective with my review.  Most of the food was OK, let down by the ribs and insipid drinks.  The seating and table was crowded and far too small for two people.     

At best I felt this could have been a rating of 3/OK review if it hadn't been for the poor seating, overly crowded experience, very average food and drinks and poor value for money.

It is certainly not very good or excellent, I would expect something that was memorable and unfortunately nothing about this restaurant delivered that or certainly not memorable in a positive way.

By way of contrast the following night we went to a restaurant ranked around 1700 in  London, the food, service and experience was significantly better and it was better value for money.

The portions were surprisingly incredibly generous and very filling so make sure you miss breakfast before coming! Staff were very attentive with the free...flowing Prosecco mimosas and the price was incredibly good value! A special shout out to Stephane who was so welcoming and chatty, telling us the story of the company and showing interest in our visit to London. Fantastic experience.
"
Scarlett Green,"We had booked this restaurant based on a review on YouTube, and we were not disappointed at all! We arrived a few minutes late but that was no issue with our booking. We had booked for brunch and hadn't booked a slot for bottomless, however...were informed we could do this option if we wanted, and couldn't have been happier. The bottomless brunch costs ¬£39.50 but is such good value for money, you get any savoury dish and any sweet off the menu. Shout out to the fancy bacon roll, which was on of the nicest meals we have had. The Prosecco served with your brunch also comes as bottles, so you aren't waiting for service, which makes a huge difference. You are also provided fresh orange to make your prosecco into a mimosa if you wish. 
I wanted to shout out to Stefan who went above and beyond for us, making our visit a special one. Could not recommend Scarlett Green enough and will 100% return!
"
Scarlett Green,"We were curious as to what this would be like as most of the reviews seemed to be about bottomless brunch and we were taking advantage of their ¬£47.50 evening experience.  For that price we got a massive pitcher of pornstar martini and then free...flowing Prosecco as well as a sharing meat board and desert.  The free flowing Prosecco really was free flowing.  They would leave a bottle on our table and then replace it when it was gone - no quibbling about how much we'd drunk.

The food was incredible.  The meat was cooked to perfection and the corn was delicious.  Sauces were topped up when we ran out and there was a lovely touch of an extra dessert being provided when one of us didn't like theirs.  

We loved the vibe of this place and thought it was excellent value for money.
"
Scarlett Green,"Had such a fabulous time. Really made my birthday extra special. Food was 10/10 and staff were really attentive (especially Stephan) - definitely recommend doing the bottomless brunch, great value for money.
"
Scarlett Green,"Scarlett Green is part of a small chain of restaurants dotted around London, offering a modern dining experience with inspiration from Mediterranean, Asian and Australian cuisine, and this restaurant in particular is well loved for its breakfast offerings - it's in close proximity to a...lot of great competition, but measures up well.

The Shakshouka is a North African inspired dish, don't be alarmed that isn't burnt toast - it's served with activated charcoal sourdough, soft and freshly roasted, perfect for dipping into the perfectly poached eggs, and soaking up some of the rich and spicy tomato sauce.  The presentation speaks for itself, but the abundance of flavour in the dish I cannot express here.  It's really worth a visit to sample for yourself.

The coffee and the service were excellent, and whilst this meal with a couple of drinks will set you back close to ¬£20 this is a rare treat that's worth splashing out for next time you fancy a boujee breakfast
"
Scarlett Green,"I unfortunately had high expectations for this place. Waiters were very slow to take our order and it took a lot of effort to get their attention to get the bill. They didn't make any effort to clean the chairs as they were full of...crumbs. The food was good although the knife provided was not sharp enough to cut through the sourdough bread. We ordered the french toast which was nice but the honeycomb pieces dotted around the plate didn't add much to the experience as they were far too chewy and toothpacking. 

I wish I could give this a higher rating but it was just a bit disappointing.
"
Scarlett Green,"Loved the decor in here, all very Aussie and Bondi themed!
We all enjoyed our meals, I had the Healthy Start.  It was a good amount of food for the price, I would have preferred the poached eggs slightly more cooked though.
The music was...very loud where we were sat which meant it was quite difficult to communicate with the waitress.
The gin I had was very expensive though, ¬£8.90 for a single.

Andy's Greek Taverna,"Could not recommend this restaurant highly enough! We came across this completely by chance while wandering around Camden on a Sunday afternoon 

The restaurant was busy (always a good sign) but nothing was too much trouble for the lovely staff. The atmosphere was exactly like...being in a taverna in Greece, lots of hussle and bustle and people laughing and enjoying their meals 

The food and wine were exceptional , I had prawn and avacado starter and lamb chops (insanely good!!) my fella had saganaki and stiffado. We had two bottles of delicious Greek red and an Irish coffee each and the bill came to 100 pounds!! Absolutely bargain!

A gem of a find, we will üíØ be back next time we‚Äôre in town !

Andy's Greek Taverna,"We went to Andy's last Sunday.  Our first time there, and it's now on our list of places to eat whenever we visit London.  It was busy, with a bustling vibrant atmosphere on a Sunday night.

And our dinner was very good value for money - four hungry people ate well for under ¬£100.  Definitely recommended!

Andy's Greek Taverna,"There‚Äôs a clear reason why this place is voted the best Greek restaurant in London - it serves amazing tasting food at a good price and has a warm and welcoming atmosphere. We visited from Dorset for our first time eating here and very glad...we made the trip across city from our hotel to try it out. Staff were busy but friendly and the generous servings of food was worth the (slight)wait in this popular place.

"
Andy's Greek Taverna,"My husband, myself and our daughter and fiance' had a lovely meal in this restaurant last night, our first meal out (but inside a restaurant) since last August.
Restaurant is well spaced out inside, so plenty of space between tables, hand sanitiser on the wall...upon entry, very clean, staff wear masks while serving and nearly all customers observed the mask wearing while moving between tables or using the toilets.

Two of us ordered the Meze and the other two ordered the set Mixed Grill option with the three dish cold starters and between the four of us we shared all dishes. The food was very fresh and tasty, one of the better Mezes that I have had in a Greek restaurant, not overwhelming in size and very good value. The Meze had the added bonus of Kleftico (a speciality dish - the lamb melted in your mouth), which is usually not the norm but a very pleasant addition.

Service in the most part was very good, we only had a little issue with the young waitress in that she did not give us a tap water when ordered and when asked for it, again it did not materialise until we asked one of the male waiters and then they immediately got it for us.  Not sure if the young waitress could understand us, but this happened again when requesting more bread and the bill, she just went outside to serve someone else, but eventually both materialised. Other than that small issue the service was perfect. When the bill came the (owner I believe) gave us a complimentary shot of Amaretto each, which was a nice touch.

Will definitely be returning and would highly recommend this restaurant for a lovely meal out.
"
Andy's Greek Taverna,"We booked ahead through OpenTable and thank God we did as the restaurant was very full when we arrived, just one vacant table remaining reserved for us.
Such a warm welcome by all the staff - as if we were family!
Not familiar with Greek...wines we asked Andy for a recommendation, he went to gather a few bottles from the bar and insisted on giving us a wine tasting session until we found a bottle we liked. We picked a lovely med-dry white.
The food was fantastic, so tasty and fresh. Halloumi and king prawn starters followed by mixed kebab mains, fries and a Greek salad.
We left so full!
I'd definitely recommend Andy's to anyone visiting London/Camden for excellently priced tasty food, considering it's central London!
"
Andy's Greek Taverna,"I visited this restaurant with 4 of my friends on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The outdoor seating is good because there is a lot of sunlight that keeps you warm in UK spring weather. 

Food was yummy: we ordered a mix of starters- dips, gallium...is etc. The best part was the warm homemade pita style bread. For my main I ordered a whole fish which was deliciously cooked and it was a really large portion for the ¬£15 price ( I had to take some home)

My favourite part were the staff who were extremely friendly and welcoming. They made sure we had everything we needed.
I really loved it and will recommend to anyone for a family meal. 

If you miss Greece or just need to feel like you are on holiday during uk lockdown - it‚Äôs the place.

Andy's Greek Taverna,"This was a birthday celebration for two valued friends and there were approximately 16 of us at Andy‚Äôs restaurant. The staff were absolutely fantastic and it‚Äôs never an easy task for the staff members to take orders from so many people at once. The young...guy was really efficient and extremely helpful as was the manager of the restaurant. Nothing was too much trouble and the food was really good! Superb flavours, good portion sizes , a great variety of food available to suit all tastes and dietary requirements. 

We had the annex room next to the main restaurant which was absolutely perfect for a private dinner party. 

We got to meet Andy the owner too who was very nice and wanted to ensure that we were all happy with our food and service. I‚Äôm delighted to say we all left full and absolutely satisfied! 

I would highly recommend this restaurant for an intimate dinner for 2 in the main restaurant (I did have a peek!) or for something larger like a party then opt for the private dining area next door! 

You‚Äôll be guaranteed good service , outstanding food and reasonable prices! It‚Äôs a YES from me!!

Andy's Greek Taverna,"Visiting London from Devon for football on Saturday, my son and I visited this wonderful restaurant last Friday having discovered it whiist googling ‚Äògood restaurants in Camden‚Äô and we were not disappointed.  

Having had numerous holidays to our Greek
Islands cancelled we we were craving...good Greek food and hospitality, Andy‚Äôs Taverna ticks all the boxes.

The staff were fabulous they can‚Äôt do enough for you having first confirmed my email for the booking, Georgina greeted us. The restaurant is in 2 sections the first very full but we were given a quiet table in the corner next door, it even had Greek music playing on the TV.

The Mythos beer went down so quickly we had to order 2 more however the jewel of this whole place is the food.

Two types of Dolmades, one vegetarian one meet plus a plate of Calimari arrived, fresh and delicious with bread.
Then the main was Andy‚Äôs mixed Souvlaki (we forgot to order fried potato but within minutes the waiter had delivered them no problem) and I had probably the best Moussaka I have ever tasted absolutely delicious just like being in Greece!   Every main course is served with a bottomless Greek salad but we could only manage one!

There‚Äôs was simply no room for dessert which was a pity but we will definitely return this was an amazing experience thank you everyone at Andy‚Äôs Taverna Camden.

We were looking for a lebanese restaurant and after a quick search on Google we found out this restaurant called Chamisse.  We even came back on saturday because we had...such a great experience the first time.
As soon as we arrived the owner made us feel very welcomed, comfortable and gave us a good table. 
The meals were absolutely delicious : the shish taouk, the hommos, tabouleh twist, moutabbal baba ghanouj, fattayer were so good, we took some wara inab and these were the best i‚Äôve ever tasted.
The owner had been so nice to us while we were there, he was so kind and gracious, it‚Äôs so rare to meet such genuine nice people in this world. Every time we needed something he was there for us always smiling and making sure his staff would take care of us. He even gave us free delicious baklawa while he didn‚Äôt have to. 
To finish I want to thank the owner again for everything and all the various helpful tips he gave us. So from now everytime we‚Äôll go to London we‚Äôll eat at Chamisse.
If you like eating lebanese you have to eat there and it will be for a reasonable price.

I was there for a friend‚Äôs birthday celebration and the owner and his staff could not have done more for us, not only providing attentive service but...treating us not just as customers but as friends. 
The cold meze starters were so varied and delicious - the best stuffed vine leaves and falafel I remember having. The grilled meats for main course were tender and full of flavour.
Our party was in the restaurant for several hours, given all the time we wanted to enjoy the occasion and not hurried out to repossess the tables. Our comfort and  delight was very obviously important to the owner and made for a very special day.

Chamisse,"I organised a party there for friends. I reserved for 12, uncertain of exactly how many would turn up. In the end 15 turned up and we moved the tables ourselves. The biggest problem was the set menus at either ¬£35 or ¬£30. They sounded...impressive, but actually the portions were small, and we had no choice of what was on the set menus at all.  The food was distinctly underwhelming. I had chosen Lebanese as it's my favourite, but I really wasn't feeling it.
The acoustics are TERRIBLE. The back room is not big, there was one other party., I couldn't here my friends talk. There was also a lot of haggling to get a mixture of ¬£30 and ¬£35 options. With obligatory service of 12.5% put on, our party of 15 paid ¬£633, which included five bottles of wine @¬£20. This does seem very steep, given that several people felt the food was nothing special.
I am not sure how many baklava they delivered? one each? again extremely small.
Lastly, I made it clear it was my birthday- -thought there would be at least a bun or something small. Absolutely nothing.
The people are lovely. No doubt about it really lovely. But despite research it wasn't the right choice.

Chamisse,"We were lucky enough to stumble upon Chamisse a couple of weeks ago on a visit to London. Fortunately they had a table available for 2 of us and what a 'find' this was.  The food was exquisite and our host and his nephew absolutely...charming.  They advised us upon the food, in particular the dishes that we had not come across before  and which wine would go well with our courses (we are reltively experienced in eating Lebanese food).  This really is a top class place.  I am returning to London for work in July and Chamisse will be the first restaurant that I book for dinner.
"
Chamisse,"Luckily for me, I've eaten out a lot over the years, including a lot of Lebanese food, and I can honestly say this is the best Lebanese food I've ever eaten. 

We opted to try lots of the starters and every one was an absolute...taste sensation. The highlight for me was the lentil soup, fantastic. For my children, they thought the gilled halloumi and the grilled chicken wings were the best. (Plus the freshly made fruit juices of course!)

The restaurant has a lovely decor, and the chap who served us (I think one of the owners), had a lovely chilled out, peaceful but fun demeanour, and was well informed so the whole time there was so relaxed.

I will be returning there as much as I possibly can when in London. 

We went on a midweek in the holidays. I booked about an hour in advance simply because I thought it would be necessary with all the new rules, but at the back of my mind thinking ""how busy will it be midweek in July along the Grey's Inn Road?"" Turned out it was full I think by about 1pm. Everyone had booked. So I would advise booking, even if you think it might be necessary!
"
Chamisse,"My husband and I had dinner at this Lebanese restaurant and the food was beyond our expectations. For the starters, we ordered stuffed vine leaves ( they were very fresh and tasted as good as when my mother in law makes them), we also had...moutabal and tabouleh. Everything was fresh and feels like home made. For mains we had a mixed grill and okra lamb dish which I recommend if you feel like some traditional full of flavour home made food. We booked for 8 and we thought that they close at 9, so we were rushing to not keep them wait too long but luckily the manager who was extremely nice made sure to tell us that we can stay as long as we like as they open late ( only the kitchen finishes at 9) and he brought up 2 delicious Lebanese pastries for free at the end. We had great time and we really appreciated every small effort they make to keep their clients happy.
"
Chamisse,"Firdaous great pleasure to serve you as always. Great that you enjoyed your evening hope to see you again soon. Stay safe.
"
Chamisse,"Outstanding! When we first arrived we where sat at a comfortable table in which there was plenty of room for all 4 of us, the restaurant isn‚Äôt massive but they haven‚Äôt made the cardinal sun of ramming as many tables in to increase capacity, so...his made the experience very intimate.
We where met by a gentleman who was clearly very passionate about the cuisine and he asked if we would entrusted his judgment with the menu and bring a host of dishes to the table, I‚Äôm so glad we did, the food was outstanding and everything was served in a timely manner. We can‚Äôt thank the team enough for making our visit very enjoyable
"
Chamisse,"I booked a table for an early dinner, so that the restaurant would be quieter.

The staff, as always, gave me a warm welcome and offered me my choice of tables. I wanted a relaxed meal, while doing some reading, and the service was attentive...and perfectly placed, so that I felt comfortable enough to take my time, but also so that I never waited for service.

I ordered the Taboulleh Twist, houmous Beiruty, Falafel and Yakhnet Batinjen Vegetarian, and enjoyed some Lebanese coffee with it. At the end, I had their refreshing Caf√© Blanc with some baklava.

Every dish was amazing, and I would visit weekly if I could.
"
Chamisse,"Visited this restaurant with my son for the 4th time and it was better than ever. Staff all very attentive and knowledgable,  Exceptionally good food - ordered bread and Labneh ( thick yogurt garlic mint and lemon dip) just my favourite dip since I ordered...it the first time. Followed by lamb and okra dish with tomato and coriander. Generous portions, very tasty stew meat very tender. Followed by small pastries - just lovely. Very reasonably priced.  Front of house personal attention and genuine care for their customers  was in itself a reason to return - backed up by the quality of food.
"
Chamisse,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but this is the best Lebanese food I‚Äôve had in my whole life. I eat Lebanese food in restaurants usually once a week in London and also ate in many Lebanese restaurants in a lot of other countries including Lebanon,...but this is 100% the best Lebanese meal I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs a must try!!! What‚Äôs more it‚Äôs also very reasonably priced and the service is very attentive. I‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Chamisse,"Spotted this restaurant was very high in the list of restaurants in London but very reasonably priced in comparison so made the way across town for a visit. Very glad I did. The food is fantastic. Would recommend the hummus, salads, mixed grill but the...haloumi is phenomenal. The House Red is, like everything, from Lebanon and very good value. The host is a gent too; happy to discuss the menu with you.
"
Chamisse,"Amamzing and mouthwatering food! The whole experience from start to finish is great, the staff are always so friendly and kind. The food is simply delicious, very generous portions, good value for money. Always a great spot for a friends and family get together.

PS:...the grilled Aubergine is a real turn on üòÅ.

Keep up the good work guys and a big thank you to Rabi for making our night special.
"
Chamisse,"Our first Lebanese meal and it didn't disappoint us. Being a family run business the quality and service was excellent. We were guided through the menus by the owner who made us feel very at ease and was kind enough to help us decide what...we wanted.. We varied our dishes to give us an opportunity to see and taste a variety of food.

The food was fabulous, complemented by the service which was fabulous.

Will definitely be back next time we're in London
"
Chamisse,"Nicely laid out Lebanese restaurant, which looks as if it also serves the local Lebonese community.
Seasonally decorated, and very pleasant owner and staff.
Tried the parsley salad with lettuce and pomegranate seeds, which was delightful, coming with superlight, freshly made flatbreads.
The mince skewer...mains, and chargrilled fish were excellent, the potato and rice sides were great too, special praise due for the rice.
Never saw the wine list, but got an inexpensive bottle of Lebanese white.
Excellent service, great food, and super value.
Thoroughly recommended.

I usually don't eat at Italian restaurants because...99% are fake and generally very expensive. But Spasso is another story, they give you a warm welcome, deliver friendly but professional service and treats you in a manner that make your experience joyful. Honourable mention to the chef, the open kitchen lets you see him cooking and you can notice the use of only genuine and refined Italian products. The Chef is a hell of professional and as an Italian in love with cooking I can't thank him enough for bringing a piece of real Italy to North West London. Last but not least the cocktails, those guys really know what they do behind the counter, always excellent and well presented drinks. Bravi ragazzi continuate sempre cos√¨!

Spasso,"We went to Spasso for a night out treat and have dinner. It's near Willesden Green tube station on Friday and oh my... üòç

The food was amazing, the wine excellent and the service impeccable. 
A little more pricey than other Italian restaurants and we...did end up having 3 courses, but it was absolutely worth it. 

As a vegi I selected the Cuoppo - deep fried ricotta, courgettes and sourdough, the gorgonzola gnocchi and amaretto tiramisu, with a Gavi di Gavi wine. My partner had some gorgeous plump looking mussels, a pork cheek ragu and buccatini and a chocolate almond cake.

We left stuffed to the gills, our tastebuds extremely happy and determined to give good reviews üôÇ It was so good, we didn't even get round to taking pics of the food, just made groaning happy noises with each mouthful üòÉ 

Def my favourite Italian restaurant in the area! 10/10

Spasso,"It is not uncommon to find good Italian restaurants in London nowadays, however Spasso manages to set itself apart thanks to the dedication and passion of the Team and the work behind every single dish on the menu: a ""Cacio e Pepe"" is not, simply,...a ""Cacio e Pepe"" and the Chef will personally explain where the cheese and the pepper came from and when and why he specifically used that one instead of another quality or kind. The attention to details is comparable to Michelin-starred restaurants while the warmth and friendliness will make you feel you are actually enjoying a dinner in Costiera Amalfitana.

Unlike any classic Italian restaurant, the Team are not afraid to experiment and to create specials that you won't find anywhere in London.

The quality of the ingredients is second to none and the Team will go the extra mile to find the special one that will make a dish great.

Special mention also to the wonderful, inventive and award winning cocktails served at Spasso.

Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're very glad to hear that you enjoyed the food and service too, hope to see you in the near future again.
"
Spasso,"I am a Spasso customer since they opened. 

If you want to taste some really Italian dishes you MUST go there. 

Panuozzo (typical from south Italy), pizza di scarole, Zuppa di pesce, Scialatielli al cartoccio and many many more recipes are simply amazing and with...respect for tradition.

The stuff is alway there to help you and children are more than welcome. 

Cocktails and bar drinks are properly made.

Careless for customers and professionalism are top quality at spasso and my little child always enjoy talking to Luigi, Nello and other members of the staff. 

Thank you Spasso
"
Spasso,"Thank you Giuseppe for taking the time for writing such a lovely detailed review and special thanks for being our customer since the moment we opened.
We‚Äôll see you and your little one soon! :)
"
Spasso,"We went to Spasso on a Saturday night with 4 adults, 4 kids and a baby and we were warmly welcomed by everyone. The children kept a wonderful memory of this evening, for the good food and for the treatment they've received. The food is...really good, real Italian recipes! We would definitely recommend this restaurant (and come back)
"
Spasso,"Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and thanks for the appreciation, it really means a lot. Glad to hear you loved our real Italian recipes and warm welcome. Looking forward to seeing you again soon!
"
Spasso,"Being a foodie and having been to Venice, Rome and Milan last year, I can quite comfortably say that the food we receive from Spasso is equal to anything we have had in any of our trips to Italy. That is probably the highest compliment...I can give in my view.

Lello (the head chef) cares deeply about the authenticity of the food and sourcing the very best possible ingredients, which comes through in the dishes he creates. We love nearly everything on the menu. Our favourites being the Amatriciana, Orecchiette, Octopus (when it is available), Ribeye Steak, Tuna steak and the Tuna tatare, Pastiera, Ricotta with Pears (cake) Mojito Pannacotta and I could go on!

I wasn't actually fan of Negroni cocktails, but I have become one since trying them at Spasso! You must give the Smoked Negroni, Aged Negroni and Sage Negroni a try. The Tiramisu martini is wonderful as well. The bar staff are very talented, so you should also give them a chance to take you on an adventure.

The service, food and drink from Spasso is on par with restaurants on the Michelin guide including some starred restaurants I've been to. I would think they should be receiving some official recognition soon if they keep their current standard going.
"
Spasso,"What a lovely detailed review with so many compliments we don‚Äôt even know where to start saying thanks. :)

Our goal is to take people to South Italy with our food and cocktails and it seems like we totally nailed it according to your words...
"
Spasso,"Not being able to eat within the restaurant, this has been our life saver.  Their dishes are way above ‚Äútake away‚Äù standard.  I cannot believe how they can deliver a fresh pasta dish that is hot as if its just out of the kitchen, not...over cooked at all.  It‚Äôs such a treat to have the entire meal cooked and delivered to your door.  They have specials and offer great fish, meat and pasta dishes which change with what is in season.  Nice and caring people who listen to your needs.   This establishment is NOT an average restaurant that has turned into a takeaway.  This is serious Southern Italian cooking, not full of tomato sauces, but regional delicacies.   If you would like to try the best Tiramisu in the world, order theirs.  We use them regularly and enjoyed eating in the restaurant before the restrictions.
"
Spasso,"Dear Sarah,

Thank you so much for this fantastic review, we are over the moon we can make people so happy with our food. Also thank you for labelling our Tiramisu the best in the world, that just made our day! And please do come...

"
TDQ Steaks,"What a find! A fantastic steak restaurant, perfectly located just off the Thames. 

The ambiance, decor and atmosphere were great. The restaurant was new to London in 2021 and has certainly been kitted out to a high standard. 

The staff were brilliant and gave excellent...recommendations. I‚Äôm not a spice fan and they made the chimichurri sauce milder to allow me to try it. The prawn starter was delicious and the lamb was extremely tender. 

The steaks are a must try if only going the once! 
This has become our new local and well worth the visit from further afield!
"
TDQ Steaks,"i visited this newly opened restaurant with my wife, as the restrictions eased. well worth the price, the near empty restaurant, had provided the most excellent atmosphere for fine dining even during these vacant times. my wife and i were treated with the upmost respect...and astonishing service. 

The food, my wife and i had ordered two servings of the delicate tuna tartare, with an exciting balance of flavour and texture. the tuna was delicate and fresh served on a bed of mango and tomato, topped with caviar and a crouton.

The steak! was my  absolute highlight of my day was tucking into the most succulent and juicy New Zealand bred steak. with a side of crispy chips and peppercorn sauce.
"
TDQ Steaks,"Went on a quiet Sunday evening. One waitress and only 3 tables occupied. The waitress was polite but very inexperienced and not what you would expect for the prices on the menu. We were not offered water. We liked the concept of the tasting steaks...and the steaks were very good. The chips however were like they were oven chips from the adjacent Tesco and the Hollandaise sauce would have tasted better if it was from Tesco. They even charge for mustard. For this restaurant to survive the end of its rent free the overall experience needs to match the steaks.
"
TDQ Steaks,"Service was amazing from the lady who was on this evening (thankyou) 
Sadly our experince was dampened by our toppings being forgotten as they arrived some time after our steaks. Mine was blue so barely warm anyway! Food was however amazing and delicious, We wanted...dessert but at 10.30 we were told no desserts as the chefs had had a long day and shut the kitchen! So we asked for the bill, we paid and requested a VAT receipt, to which we were told the manager had been asked, no problem after some time I asked again for the VAT number, everything thing seemed a little disorganised! The lovely lady serving us bent over backwards  and seemed embarresed at times which is sad to see in such an establishment. Food and service good but the final details from the management let this place down sadly.
"
TDQ Steaks,"Went with my boyfriend and we both had such a great time. The food and cocktails were fantastic and I need to give a special shout-out to our waitress Dorota who looked after us so well and gave fantastic suggestions. Will for sure go back...next time we‚Äôre in the area
"
TDQ Steaks,"My Wife and I had a few days in London that included our 28th Wedding Anniversary, we stayed at the nearby Park Plaza Riverbank.

We had dinner at TDQ on the 20th of July and it was amazing.

We chanced our arm with a 'walk...in' as the hotel menu didn't grab our attention, we're so glad we did.

We got a very warm welcome from Dorota and a great table by the window, ordering was easy and the service was prompt. 

The Canadian Bison Fillet will leave a lasting memory, without a doubt the finest steak we've eaten, the service was great too.

There is an excellent range of Wine, Beer & Spirits too.

The place is spotlessly clean & there's plenty of space so you won't feel crowded (ideal for those of us still trying to swerve this COVID virus).

In short great food with excellent service, we'll go back anytime.

TDQ Steaks,"Great location and the place looks expensive, unfortunately this ends there. Very inexperienced and untrained staff, food is mediocre and presentation is even worst. In fact vs the prices, it is astonishing. 
Sauces feel like they from tesco as well as the bread. Oily edamame...beans, Crinkle chips were soft and soggy. Paid ¬£17 for 3 prawns and some sauce, again wet. Steaks came on a large plate and the blood was running, making a small puddle. We know our steak and go to cut, hawksmore etc regularly and wanted to try this place. Unfortunately it was a very expensive mistake.

TDQ Steaks,"Dear Sanam,

We are deeply sorry that you had a bad experience at our place. We are taking serious note of this and will investigate what was going wrong. Our aim is to stand for quality and service at all times. And in this case...
"
TDQ Steaks,"Was amazing! Staff were lovely and was a very professional atmosphere. Food took a while to come but it was explained that everything is freshly made. 
Really enjoyed the food. 
Only reason for not the 5 stars is I personally think it‚Äôs quite overpriced and...I‚Äôd like to suggest if people are buying steaks maybe incorporate sides too as steaks alone are expensive I‚Äôd expect a side thrown in. 
Overall was lovely and definitely recommend for a celebration.
"
TDQ Steaks,"We came here recently to take the advantage of 50% off promotion. The food  was very good, we each had a starter and steaks. 

The staff were friendly and pleasant. However, if you are in a rush, you may find the service is a bit...slow. There was a long gap between our starter and the main. But we were offered a free steak to share, which we thought was a nice gesture.

The drink prices are somewhat extortionate, especially water. A small bottle was like ¬£5, bigger bottle was ¬£15. So if you are not fussy, probably order tap water. 

But all in all, it's good experience.
"
TDQ Steaks,"We had a very enjoyable evening here. 241  on cocktails that were fantastic. We tried the wagyu starter which was tasty but pricey, oysters superb, followed by 2 fantastic fillet steaks. The service, owner(chef) and atmosphere fantastic. Would have liked some better chips. Wishing this...fantastic steak house all the best. 
We will definitely return!!
"
TDQ Steaks,"I couldn‚Äôt take pictures because we were enchanted by the smell and the looks of the food,we just wanted to enjoy it  so we did. Food is absolutely delicious , the staff is a pleasure to talk to and to be served by,Renato stood out...for being so attentive,kept checking on us,he‚Äôs very nice and he knows his drinks too. The rest of the staff too is very helpful and knowledgeable. 
I know they are new here in London and they truly deserve a shoutout. We absolutely enjoyed our date night thanks to them!!
"
TDQ Steaks,"I agree with all the positive reviews on this page. We had such a lovely evening at this restaurant- the food was amazing, the staff were attentive and very friendly and the restaurant itself is new, sleek and very pleasant. It is easily the best...steak we have had South of the river and it is a lovely destination for a nice meal in the area. The steak was excellent - cooked to perfection and it‚Äôs grilled so had a yummy charcoal taste. The tomato salad was delicious and the Argentinian Malbec a very nice accompaniment. The chocolate cake dessert was also really good! Everything tasted very fresh. We will definitely be back - thank you so much for a lovely evening!
"
TDQ Steaks,"We were a table of 6 spending some time in London and thought we would like to eat a good steak . Well we were not disappointted .
Our meals were superb with first class service and the price was very reasonable for what experience...we all had .

Would reccommned to anyone albiet a steak lover or not because they have fantastic seafood as well.
"
TDQ Steaks,"Booked a table and made told the restaurant it was for a birthday celebration. Venue was nice and service was really slow but we didn't mind as we were having a good time chatting.

 The steaks were excellent but they had clearly run of of...chips and rather than tell us and give us a chance to change our sides, we were served McCain oven chips! Ordinarily I would have made a fuss but didn't want to ruin the birthday dinner so I let the manager know why my chips weren't eaten and that it wasn't good enough. He simply said, he'll pass the comments on to the chef. They clearly take customers for granted, simply not good enough.

Taste Of Nawab,"You can't beat Abdul's Taste of Nawab on Colney Hatch Lane or as I have had more recently home deliveries. The food always arrives hot and in perfect condition. Everything is top quality. The onion bahjjis are  crunchy and brilliantly oniony, the papadums crisp and...fresh, the nans warm, soft and doughy. I'm a meat eater (and the chicken/lamb dishes are excellent), but my family are non-meat eaters, so we stick with veggie and fish dishes. Tilapia fish is tops  ‚Äì lovely, strong, distinctive sauce, great firm pieces of Tilapia. The Dahl is a must. Actually pretty much all of it is a must ‚Äì aubergine and potato (yum), matar paneer (yum), aloo gobi  and chana (yum). None of it is greasy, none of it is burn-your-throat hot, all of it is super tasty, beautifully cooked, good value for money, and generously portioned. Best of all is Abdul ‚Äì such a lovely, warm, kind man. I couldn't recommend Taste of Nawab more strongly,. It really is a a taste of Nawabbian heaven.

"
Taste Of Nawab,"There are 2 main reasons why I've giving Taste of Nawab 5/5: Customer service and Freshness. 

It's really strange to feel like I need to declare a bias on this one... I've only been here twice, I don't even know any of the staffs names,...yet I feel like I'm writing a review for a mate, which can surely only be testament to how friendly and accommodating the staff here are.

I know this seems like a given, but some people do consider this when ordering a takeaway so I'll say it: They do speak perfect English. Obviously that's not a requirement for cooking delicious food, but when you might be spending ¬£40 on a family take away, it's nice to know that the staff aren't going to misunderstand your order and you'll be very well looked after if you need to raise a concern.

As for freshness, You can see from the photo's I've added that the naan is clearly fresh. It's fluffy whilst holding delicious baked texture on the darker crusts. Even the popadoms were noticeably fresh. In addition, the meat in the curries was tender and soft.

Taste Of Nawab,"I have been a regular at this fine Indian restaurant for a number of years & have NEVER had a bad meal. 

It was with complete astonishment that I read the review by Krunal P written in February. 

Without any doubt in my opinion this...is the best restaurant for this cuisine I have visited & the number of positive reviews confirm that, 

The service by Abdul & Rana is exemplary, friendly, professional & very thoughtful. 

The food has always been freshly prepared, cooked exactly as I have requested & tasted tantalising delicious. 

Should you be anywhere near & fancy an Indian meal, then make a call, as the restaurant is often fully booked, again a testament to the high standard of the quality offered. 

Btw, an alternative to eating in would be too join the large number of people who order a takeaway, in the short time we were eating in the restaurant, approximately 45 minutes, there were well over 12 orders going out on takeaways. 

This is a must to go place for high quality food, friendly service & good value.

In our opinion this is a definite place to visit where you can enjoy quality food and service, feel wanted & comfortable. 

We look forward to our next visit & more great food.

Then saw the reviews eslewhere and I thought i try

With 100% No way can this place be anywhere on top 10 or even top 5000 thats for sure...in london.

Had to throw away the lamb chops, were stale and re-warmed. x 2 Curry's had hints of tomota and lacked real taste.

Paid ¬£4.50 for two small kebeb starters, size of AA batteies, they should be ashamed to charge this.

1 star as atleast some food was edible food and i didnt have to throw away

To mangement be honest - Stuff like this really puts me off Trip Advisor.

It has been our favourite Indian restaurant for the last few years and we can see how busy it is with the takeaway food on constant go and also by those who dine in like us. 

It does not make sense why someone would write a negative review as we know Mr Abdul would rather to find out if someone was not satisfied with  their food and make it right.

Amrutha Lounge,"I chose this restaurant to have a bday celebration for my partner. 

We arrived, and already knew we were going to have the bigger selection. And to no disappointment! One selection for both people fully feeds  2 people, and only one refill we needed- rice....We were full for hours afterwards.

Everything was so delicious! Gazpacho was more like a desert. Currys were smashing. Salads, especially the kale one - OMG! 

We both thought ¬£25 per person is worth for what we got, even we didn't need the huge refill. The quality of the food, and the service is something we gladly paid for. Not to mention the feature BYOB, where you don't pay the fees, as oppose to other restaurants.

This is the place we will go back to, and take our friends too. I can now understand why the week ahead they were already booked out and only a few slots were left for the day :)
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Absolutely amazing vegan Indian food (though I genuinely think you could take all but the most vociferous meat-eater there without them even noticing), and the staff are so friendly.

They work on rotation, so even the head chefs switch out with the servers, and everyone...gets paid the same. They all seemed so genuinely happy to be there, and talked enthusiastically about the food and the business.

They make their own (gorgeous) herbal tea, and when my friend complimented it they put a bunch in a takeaway container for him and explained at length different ways to brew it. You pay per person and every table eats the same selection of stuff tapas-style from either the base or another, slightly expanded, menu (unless you specifically decide to order individual dishes, but that would be a mistake because everything is amazing). Get the expanded menu; the lentil falafel are absolutely to die for. The dahl and green curry are also exceptional. 

Refills of anything you like are free, and you may well be sent home with a takeaway box of your favourite dish for tomorrow's lunch.

Oh! And they have a rule that if you can't afford to eat there you can volunteer some time instead. Which is just so great, and a business model I'd go out of my way to support even if the food wasn't so spectacular.

Alcoholic drinks are BYOB, with glasses provided and no corkage charge.

I can't recommend Amrutha Lounge highly enough. We will absolutely be back. The only slight criticism I can level is that it was very loud when we were there, but I think that's largely testament to the relaxed atmosphere and how excited people are to be back eating at restaurants.
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Wow. What can I say. This restaurant was absolutely amazing in all aspects. The staff were so friendly (even though we were being a bit rowdy) and the food was delicious. Great value for price - they kept bringing food out until we were really...full! I can‚Äôt recommend highly enough. We were really difficult customers (some of the lads complaining about wanting chicken wings quite loudly) and they treated us so well. Thank you for a fab evening.
"
Amrutha Lounge,"As a committed meat lover, I was skeptical about going to Amrutha, but went based on the recommendation of friends & family.  I was blown away by the quality and presentation of the many and varied dishes served.  Everything was delicious and beautifully presented, and...made me completely forget about the fact that  all dishes were meatless.  Desserts and herbal tea were wonderful.  Prices were very reasonable, and the friendly, efficient, and informal service made for a wonderful vibe.  Highly recommended whether or not you are vegan!
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Excellent, tasty, food, which is freshly prepared. With the set price menus, food can be topped up as much as you like. Kale salad is out of this world..who knew kale could taste so good?! 

Everyone that works here is super friendly & helpful. Their...ethos is 'no man goes hungry' so if you can't pay for your meal, you can work for a couple of hours  instead. 

This place is all about preparing & serving the food with love..   I'll be returning soon!
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Wow wow wow‚Ä¶I LOVE Amrutha Lounge! 

I visited with my friends, and we had such a fab evening. The staff are wonderful, so friendly and accommodating- they can‚Äôt do enough for you. Then there‚Äôs the food- oh my. Even my non vegan friends were blown...away. 
We had the selection where you get curries, rice, salads, pakoras, falafels, dips‚Ä¶it was all delicious with so much flavour- and then we had the brownie for dessert which was rich, decadent and served with the salted caramel peanut butter ice cream which was the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was vegan/ plant based. 
What‚Äôs more is they keep topping you up and you can eat as much as you like and also you‚Äôre free to bring your own wine. What more could you possibly want! 

I loved it here it was heaving even on a Thursday evening, which tells you all you need to know. I will be bringing my partner back because I‚Äôve not stopped banging on about it since. Thank you Amrutha Lounge. Perfection!
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Visited last night with high expectations and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Excellent value for money, unlimited refills on food, (which was delicious), and byob! I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian but thought the food was amazing. What really made the experience though was...the staff, all lovely and so attentive. The owner of the restaurant was waiting tables and was the best waiter I‚Äôve ever had, very humble lovely people. Did not try and attempt to upsell, recommended the simpler cheaper menu as was the first time, explained all the dishes and recommended what went well together. Very lovely experience, and topped all the dishes up at the end just so we could take them all home in takeaway dishes! Fantastic restaurant, never change!
"
Amrutha Lounge,"I cannot recommend Amrutha Lounge enough! My boyfriend (who eats meat) booked a table for my birthday because he liked a ethos. Once we got there we were warmly welcomed, the staff explained the menu options (we went for the buffet menu) and then the...food arrived.... it was quite literally the best vegan meal I have ever had. So tasty, fresh and flavourful. Wonderful spice levels and creative flavouring of the none spiced dishes. The menu promised top ups of our dishes and the staff proactively made sure we were offered this more than once. As it was my birthday, we opted to have a pudding. These were so wonderfully creamy and delicately sweet. The staff all sang happy birthday to me too. It was just so friendly and a wonderful experience. I will be back and bring more friends to experience it. Thank you all at Amrutha for helping make my birthday special in these very uncertain times.
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Absolutely delicious breakfast - fresh juices, very nice granola to start, and the best savoury breakfast toasts I have ever had. The avocado toast with dehydrated tomatoes and herby garlic oil is incredible and so is the cashew cheese toast with the mushrooms and chilis....Left feeling full, happy and energized. I will be going again tomorrow. If you're after a healthy but delicious breakfast, this is the place.
"
Amrutha Lounge,"So wonderful to walk into a restaurant with a wonderful buzz for the first time in too long. The Amrutha team were as welcoming as ever and  it was visible how excited they were to be able to open their doors to diners once again....The food was incredible and so much love goes in to each plate they prepare. Always excellent value for money, and it's always so nice to be offered 'top-ups' and Tupperware for leftovers to take away. 
The service came with a huge smile from all the team and was excellent as always! Thanks guys, see you soon!!
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Amrutha is an amazing vegan Indian restaurant. Fresh, delicious, fantastic. It is casual and relaxed. It is reasonably priced and you can bring your own alcohol and have as much of any dish as takes your fancy. I had a wonderful evening catching up with...old school friends.
"
Amrutha Lounge,"I have had my eye on this place for quite a while and when my mum asked me where I wanted to go for lunch, I chose here. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful and we opted for the banquet menu of ¬£18 per...head. This included pakoras, rice, salad, daal, Thai curry, beetroot salad and a variety of dips including cashew cheese and some kind of spicy tamarind sauce. 

The food was excellent and even my mum who is a meat eater enjoyed it. 

I thought that the buffet style was a great idea but I probably wouldn‚Äôt get it again purely because there is so much food that it‚Äôs hard to stop eating it! 

The waitress asked which dishes we liked and when I told her the pakoras, daal, beetroot salad and dips, she brought more out for us. Obviously we ended up taking these home with us. 

My mum also mentioned that it was my birthday and so during our meal she brought over some sweet potato balls to try and also gave me a slice of brownie to take home. It was so kind and thoughtful of her. 

I would say that it‚Äôs a shame that the buffet has to be a minimum of two people because ideally it would have been nice to try something else and not have to choose either this to share or a main. 

All in all this is a lovely restaurant but be prepared to leave absolutely stuffed!
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Definitely make plans to dine at Amrutha Lounge and you will not regret it. Even seasoned carnivores will enjoy the culinary delights on their menu. This is my favourite vegan restaurant. The incredible flavours on their menu make this a gastronomic delight whether you are...vegan or not.

Each time I go, I order the Amrutha Selection Grande which is essentially a banquet feast of everything on their exquisite menu and it comes with free top ups! My personal favourite is their pakora which can only be described as divinely delicious!

The dining experience is taken to the next level by the incredible Amrutha Team: Tash, Arvin, Emily and Danny. They greet you like a long lost friend and are attentive without being intrusive throughout your meal. They are all also chefs in the kitchen, clearly delight in their work and you can literally taste the love invested in preparing the food!

On top of all of this, they are also writing the Amrutha Cookbook as we speak! I can‚Äôt wait.

Please go to Amrutha Lounge and you can come back to thank me later!
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Wow! What an experience. We have just moved to the area and chanced our first vegan restaurant outing and boy did it pay off!! The staff were so warm and friendly, explained all the menu and grabbed us wine glasses for our BYO bottle straight...away. We opted for the large buffet style menu and were not disappointed. All of the food complimented each other in such an exquisite way, we only wish we had more room in our bellies for extra! The coffee cheesecake was delicious to finish on with their home made tea. We are sadly leaving London but if we ever come back it will be our first pit stop! Will be recommending to everyone! Thank you Amrutha Lounge. Much love! Xx
"
Amrutha Lounge,"Blown away by this restaurant that breaks all conventional rules, being a top dog without having the location or alcohol licence (you can bring your own bottle, though).  Lovingly prepared nourishing, eyewatering dishes, if you get one of the big plates, eat as much as...you can. Each dish perfectly prepared, be it starters, mains or dessert.  There is a fair price policy, and the hygiene rating is 4/5 stars (June 2021).  This restaurant is well worth the extra journey. The staff are very friendly too, and teh atmosphere is warm and welcoming. My only down point is that open floor restaurants like these are not the easiest to have a conversation over (difficult to hear others). But that mustn't disappoint you, because you will be busy eating. Water and tea were provided free too. Food is rich in colours and tastes, from middle eastern to curry flavours, all well done! We even got a piggy bag for our daughter to take to school of the leftovers for her lunch teh next day.  Stop thinking if, GO AND TRY!!!!!

Indian Moment,"What a fabulous evening we had!

The food was delicious, general consensus from the table was some of the best curries ever! The curry itself wasn‚Äôt greasy or oily like some curry houses, this felt very authentic, you could tell the produce they source is...obviously fresh and the spice was enjoyable not like some curry houses were the heat masks the actual taste. The sauces they bring out with the poppadom‚Äôs is game changing, extremely delicious and hard to put down once you‚Äôve started.

The fact it is BYOB and they charge a couple of quid is such a clever initiative, they also have soft drinks an water available for those who don't drink.

What made the evening was the staff, nothing was too much of a chore, they would come and open your wine bottles for you, bring glasses, clear empties and they were very tentative. Service was quick and we waited maybe 20 mins for mains and there were 15 of us. 

We will 100% be back!

Thank you from team Marshalls Mum!
"
Indian Moment,"We stumbled upon this restaurant after a night at an event with no idea of reviews. We were so impressed! The food is delicious, very obviously freshly made per order and honestly incredible! When one of the curries was too hot for my friend‚Äôs taste,...she told the staff and her plate was promptly taken away and replaced without question. The friendliest staff and the best curry i‚Äôve had in a very long time despite living in Tooting, the supposed curry capital of South London! Make sure you order naan bread. It‚Äôs heaven sent‚Ä¶!
"
Indian Moment,"Went here for a date night with my partner, the atmosphere was romantic and the service was incredible. We ordered the samosas which were fantastic, the dal makhani which was spiced perfectly and the lamb hara mossala where the lamb melted in your mouth. Would...recommend to anyone and will definitely be back again.
"
Indian Moment,"We've gone here a few times (we're a house share who live local) and it's amazing - great service, strangely fits in to a great night out as part of a celebration (can confirm, perfect for a housemate birthday), and GREAT food. It's a reasonable...spice level so be warned (if you want a proper curry, THIS is the destination to go to!) The staff are super helpful, it's bring your own drinks (and there's a helpful Tesco JUST outside) and the food is honestly to die for. We all regularly get takeaways from here as well and it's always the perfect addition to film night. Cannot suggest this place enough xoxo
"
Indian Moment,"If you are looking for an outstanding, freshly cooked Indian meal in a lively, intimate and friendly environment then Indian Moment on Battersea Rise is the perfect place for you. We have been eating at Indian Moment since it first opened on the Northcote Road...and have followed it to their new home on Battersea Rise. Their attention to detail remains consistent, the level of service impeccable and the food is always delicious with a wide variety to chose from. The classics never disappoint and there is always something new to try for the more adventurous. It's always a night out to enjoy.

Indian Moment,"Came here on a Friday night with a group of 6 of us in total! The service was 5*. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they were very attentive and friendly. The food was on a next level- lamb was tender and...the curries seasoned perfectly. Would recommend to anyone that fancies a good curry in a lovely setting. 10/10 would visit when next in London. And BYOB is a bonus!
"
Indian Moment,"We drove up from Surrey to go to Indian Moment as it‚Äôs our favourite Indian restaurant by a long way.  We try to get up at least once every month and it‚Äôs definitely worth the long drive!
It was very busy and buzzing as usual...on Saturday evening: as always, the service was superb: friendly, welcoming and attentive, without being intrusive. 
As usual, the food was excellent also: wide ranging menu, tasty, delicately spiced food, good portion sizes and beautifully presented.  We started with a nice large plate of crisp poppadums and equally crisp Kingfishers and white wine. 
For our main course we had a variety of dishes: chicken Shashlik, madras, makhani and korma, and we tried a meat Thali for the first time and were very glad we did: a large plate with a variety of small dishes plus rice, raita and nan bread. 
We finished with berry and mango sorbets which were a great way to cleanse and cool our palates.  
Our children were kept occupied (and fed and watered!) throughout and it was a really nice family get together.  It‚Äôs no wonder there was a mix of couples and families there. 
We find Indian Moment the perfect place for a nice, good quality, good value, chilled  out meal; whether it‚Äôs with friends, family or as a couple. 
We all had a great time and look forward to returning again soon.
"
Indian Moment,"A takeaway from Indian Moment never disappoints and is always delicious. Including leftovers the next day (always deliberately over order!) Our children happily tuck in to the chicken korma, chicken tikka madras, lamb rogan josh, lamb samosas (really good) and piles of naan, poppadums and...chutneys. Food is beautifully presented, plentiful, clean, and not at all greasy. The best. We wish this fantastic top quality restaurant the very best as it navigates these difficult times. I‚Äôm sure (and hope) it‚Äôs huge popularity and many loyal customers will see it through.
"
Indian Moment,"My boyfriend and I had a great evening at Indian Moment on Saturday as our first restaurant meal out post-lockdown. The staff were very friendly, courteous and kind and all the necessary social distancing/health measures were in place. Despite this, we were made to feel...very relaxed and the food was excellent as ever! We have visited many times and always had a great meal - I tried the Rajasthani Gosht lamb curry and my boyfriend had the amazing Fish Thali platter which came with a gorgeous pomegranate raita. The restaurant is currently BYOB, and our waiters were very helpful offering to store our drinks in the fridge/a wine cooler and bring them out / pour them for us to make it feel like the full restaurant experience still. Overall a great visit and would highly recommend. Thank you!
"
Indian Moment,"I drove up from Surrey (about 50 mins drive each way!) tonight to collect a takeaway for my family. Having tried everywhere round where we live, while there are some okay curry houses; nowhere comes close for the quality, taste and presentation of the food...at Indian Moment. 

The service is also excellent - the staff are so attentive and always make my family and I feel so special and welcome when we go for a sit down meal there. 

Tonight we had a mix of classic (madras, rogon josh, tikka masala) and tandoor (tikka, shashlik) dishes, along with starters and breads etc. As always, we ordered too much! Not a problem as that‚Äôs tomorrow‚Äôs lunch sorted :)

My family and I would highly recommend Indian Moment; either for a takeaway or a sit down meal.
"
Indian Moment,"This place is such a gem! I am so pleased that I discovered Indian Moment. The food is utterly divine (and at such reasonable prices) and I would recommend everything I have tried on the menu. The service is also really great and  I just...love coming here. Thank you guys!!!
"
Indian Moment,"My daughter and I had a delicious meal at Indian moment. It was such a cold wet evening, but inside it was cosy and welcoming, the food was delicious and atmosphere buzzing on a Tuesday. I could not recommend it enough. 
You must try the...Gulab sweet rice pudding.
"
Indian Moment,"We tried Indian Moment as we are local to the area and ratings were good, so we had good expectations. The atmosphere was great and the staff were (in general) very attentive. However, the food really let this restaurant down. We had a chicken tikka...masala and a patia with a garlic naan and pilau rice which were all just average. We had to send the naan back for being burnt and everything was quite bland. Really disappointed as the price of the food did not match the quality or quantity.
"
Indian Moment,"Booked our table for 7pm, very appealing that you can take your own alcohol with ¬£1.95 corkage fee. 
Was asked if we wanted popodoms before we even sat down and just assumed they were keen. Was told we only had an hour in the restaurant...which was fine but was asked 3 times what we wanted to order even though we asked for more time but was told we needed to hurry so we had more time to eat. 
Food arrived quick which was good, we were asked if we had finished 3 times even though we hadn‚Äôt and then when we had the dishes were cleared away and the bill handed to us. 
At 7.40 we were asked to leave after paying the bill even though we still had 20 minutes of our time slot left. 
Food was good, korma was quite spicy which is unusual but was fine.
"
Indian Moment,"I‚Äôve been looking for a place to place my hat on, and the food here is incredible. The food is so obviously beautifully cooked, along with freshly made naan and popadoms. Amazing service, incredible food. Best curry in London, no doubt

Bayleaf Restaurant,"Visited recently and felt immediately uncomfortable as there were no social distances between tables. Food is expensive for what you get. Small portions. Rice stale. Meat platter disappointing one lonely tough lamb chop. A few chunks of chicken and 3 oversalted kofta. A quarter of...tandoori was added. Biryaini dry and tasteless. Encouraged to  have a dumpling starter. We were given a taste on the house. Ok here we have dry ice and four frozen dumplings undercooked and it's 15 quid! Table was cleaned when diner eating left wet and staff tried to take plate when not finished! I enjoyed my company but hate being ripped off and poor food experience üòû

"
Bayleaf Restaurant,"We visited Bayleaf in November on a Sunday after seeing a public post on their social media about the extension of the eat out to help out (¬£10 off per person). When we arrived, despite booking their was no record of our booking so they...had to scramble to find a table for us. Then the fire alarm kept going off. It was very loud and regular and no one reassured the restaurant guests or apologised at all. 

The food was nice and drinks nice too. 

However, true colours were shown when it came to the bill. The social media post about the eat out to help out and the email about the scheme clearly said it was available to all guests. So, when the bill came I was surprised to see no money taken off. I asked the manager as I know mistakes happen. However instead of replying and saying he forgot and he‚Äôll add it immediately he replied ‚Äúwe ask the customer to remind us as we only give the discount to special customers with the email‚Äù

The offer was on the bayleaf Facebook and Instagram pages for everyone and for all customers. I was honestly shocked to hear such a response. Either you are running the offer or not. If you don‚Äôt want to give it to everyone then tell them they need to show an email or say a code. The manager did take the money off but I now really questions the motives and honesty of those running Bayleaf which makes me sad as I‚Äôm a big fan.
"
Bayleaf Restaurant,"Hi Bennett30,

We're happy to hear that you enjoyed your food, drinks and eat out to help out discount. 

However, we apologise for miscommunication upon your booking and receiving the bill. We'll do our very best to make sure this doesn't happen again.

Thanks,

The presentation was great, clearly the chef and team know their stuff. Slightly gimmicky with the dry ice with the main dishes but it was fun. 

The service...was super attentive and helpful. 

Most importantly, the food was very good indeed, vibrant flavours, rich without being oily. Around ¬£20 for a main dish with rice is not cheap but it felt like good value.

Once we got our table, the staff were so attentive and the two waiting staff were so comedic and kept us entertained. You can tell a lot about what goes on behind restaurant doors when the staff genuinely love what they do and get on so well with each other. The food also was delicious, this was the first Indian we had had that was tasty but not greasy and we cleaned our plates! Loved the theatrics when ordering the momo. Definitely will visit again.

The kind lady serving us on the day was straight over giving us the menu and asking about any food allergies we may of...had, don‚Äôt often get asked that question you have to ask. 

Starters were amazing nothing I can fault was wrong, fresh, warm, flavoursome home cooked food. 

We had the mixed grill, vegetable bhajiya, prawns with scallops, mixed tikka and chicken 65 and must say all was spot on. 

On the mains Maa had the baby aubergine, it is one of her favourite veggies and she was really really impressed, as they say always hard to please a Mum, but she had a huge smile. 

We got Darbari chicken and Sholay Ghost, chicken had some serious flavour and heat so defo give a try if you like it spicy. The meat was cooked to perfection literally melting like butter and must say not many Indian food places make it this good. This was served with rice and naan. 

Desserts we got Pear Brownie and A Mango and Passion Fruit cake, they surprised Maa with a birthday cake which was really nice. 

Overall I am very pleased I have found a restaurant that serves such great Indian food and being one trust me this place is a must go for any Indian food lovers. 

Place is fully Halal. 

We were also greeted by the owner which you hardly see this days and was not shy getting his hands dirty.

Alexander The Great,"We were visiting for a family night out and had booked in advance due to the wealth of really positive online reviews. We were made to feel immediately welcome by our lovely waitress Eileen, who gave us some really helpful advice on the wine, and...some excellent food recommendations. We were pointed to a weekend special barbecue, which we each ordered, and were not disappointed. We were served three types of meat (the lamb chops were especially delicious), a large Greek salad and portion of hand cut, well seasoned chips. I also asked if I could switch my chips to a portion of rice, which Eileen very kindly accommodated. The food was fresh, delicious and very generous and was an absolute bargain at ¬£20 each. We had such a wonderful night, and we loved the friendly, family atmosphere of the restaurant. Would highly recommend!

I think this will be a regular place for us when we visit London.

"
Alexander The Great,"Booked Alexander the Great for our 1st night in London after reading top quality reviews and we weren't disappointed.
As soon as we arrived we were greeted by Andy who made us feel very welcome and was extremely warm and friendly.
The smell as we...walked in instantly reminded us of our holidays in Greece.
My husband had Sardines to start followed by freshly cooked Sea Bass and I had Halloumi to start then Lamb kebab. We shared a Greek salad and the most amazing chips which were the best we have ever tasted. We ended the meal with sharing some Baklava and Kataifi for dessert which were both yummy.
The service was so amazing along with the food  and atmosphere that we returned again last night (Thursday) on our last night in London.
Again we were so warmly greeted by another gentleman Vassilis and a lady who we think could be Elaine and their customer service was exemplar. The gentleman knew we had been previously on Monday night and thanked us for returning to the restaurant again. 
This time we had again Sardines and Halloumi to start and my hubby had fresh Sea Bream which he said was cooked to perfection and delicious. I had meat Moussaka which was very very tasty and a Greek salad to share.
We were treated with the upmost respect and when we return to London we will definitely be returning as this was a true authentic Greek restaurant and the best we have found jn the UK. 
The restaurant is very popular so I would recommend booking a table do that you will not be disappointed 
Don't delay....get booking and experience the love and amazing food.

Our waiters were incredibly friendly and attentive, bringing us 5 courses pf our set menu, which was DELICIOUS! Starting with the cold mezze, following with...the warm meats and fish and finally some grilled meats- the lamb was the star of the show. So tender and flavorful. We finished with prossecco and baklavas. 
The interior and the hospitality of the staff made us all feel like we were on holiday in the middle of Greece.

Value for money is outrageous and the service is fantastic. We were served by Eileen who was great, always made...sure that everything was going perfectly and we were looked after. The food was amazing, had the mezze which was cooked over charcoal and you could tell.

There is little more to say about Alexander the Great - if you want stellar value for money and a casual but friendly Greek restaurant look no further. Would definitely return again.

Alexander The Great,"This was mine and my girlfriend‚Äôs first time here and first post lockdown date, we visited Athens late last year and it spurred on our love for Greek food but I‚Äôve never tasted mezzes like they have here, to die for! The al fresco dining...reminds you of Europe on a sunny evening. Extremely well priced for a London restaurant and the quality of service was amazing, we were looked after by Eileen who made sure we didn‚Äôt long for anything the entire time we were there, food came out quickly and as soon as Eileen worked out that my girlfriend was vegetarian she kept bringing her little extra veggie mezzes to try (free of charge). Overall couldn‚Äôt recommend this place or their staff more, makes perfect sense that they‚Äôre thanked the #3 restaurant on Trip Advisor in London. Thanks to everyone from Chefs to Eileen who made us feel special, will be back very soon.

Alexander The Great,"Absolutely amazing place
Felt like we were actually on holiday in the Greek islands

Plenty of drinks to choose from here to
We found the pricing very good for what we ate and drank
Already booked to go here again and now one of fav places to eat
Outside seating available as well as inside and staff are very friendly make you feel very welcome.we came here for our anniversary and came out very pleased

Alexander The Great,"Lovely restaurant. The food is very tasty and fresh, great customer service and nice outdoor space, all for a very risible price. I had octopus as a main course while my friends had meat and we were all very pleased with the food, plus at...the end we got limoncello on the house. I would definitely go back.

Alexander The Great,"Out in London with friends and feeling hungry, although a group of 8 people this place accommodated us with a warm welcome.  We chose a meze, a multitude of dishes served throughout our time there.  The portions were enormous and varied, and ultimately tasted delicious,...all seemed to be prepared as it should be, with care and respect.
The service was warm and refreshing, with explanations when asked on certain dishes served, the server genuinely loved the food he served and made me hungry just from the explanation of the menu.  Throughout he was attentive, approachable and friendly, nothing was too much trouble.   So thank you Andrew for your superior, kind service.
I'll be back for sure.

Alexander The Great,"My housemates and I had an amazing evening and meal last night here! We'd walked past it several times & it's always busy so we finally booked a table. 

The service and team are wonderful, especially Andy, who's incredibly welcoming and makes you feel really...looked after.

We went for the mezze - at ¬£20.95 pp you really do get a bit of everything! My favourite were the cold and hot plates to start, which were delicious and don't think we left anything! Then we were treated to a fish dish then meats and salad, so you're definitely not leaving full! Loved the fresh, charcoal grilled veg and meats.

For value for money, great service and delicious food, you really can't wrong here! Definitely will be returning.
"
Alexander The Great,"The food is good, it really feels fresh and taste bit nothing crazy! The service was poor. The waiters weren¬¥t wearing any mask, we had to wave them twice to be served. Nobody checked with us to ask if the food was good or not...or if needed anything else. And, when we asked for the bill, even though they said the service wasn¬¥t included, they charged us for it. I honestly I don¬¥t understand how this place is rated one of the best in London.

Nora Cafe,"So we went for breakfast but everything I saw I wanted to try,  Homemade meat pies, burgers, pizzas and more. The waitress was friendly and had a excellent rapport with her customers who appeared to be regulars.  Most people seemed to be workers and not...tourists. One man wanted a meat pie and our waitress assured him that she had reminded the cook to make them, so that there was one for him.
"
Nora Cafe,"Me and a friend were looking for places to eat breakfast in London and decided to try Nora Caf√© due to its proximity to Liverpool Street and its positive reviews. We decided to eat our breakfast outside and were greated by the lovely smell of...a spicy omelette from the gentleman behind us. We were also surprised by the low prices of the food items on the menu for a London Caf√© and the large array of choices. Even before eating, reading the menu was an incredibly heartwarming experience. Many of the food items including bubble and squeak and fried bread reminded of the delicious breakfast my mum makes when I am at home. I ordered the set 2 breakfast with fresh orange juice and tea and my friend ordered the set 5 breakfast with a can of Tango and some pancakes. The waitress who took our order was very pleasant and attentive. When our drinks came, I was extremely presently surprised to find that the orange juice was freshly made and not from a carton as seen in most other caf√©s. This is exsacty how my mum makes freshly squeezed juice at home. When the breakfasts came, we found them to be tasty and really good value for money. The portion sizes were perfect and the price of the breakfasts also included bread and butter or toast. The fried bread was also especially delicious and was just like my mum's fried bread at home. We were both surprised that our bills came to ¬£11 per person for everything we had, especially in London! For many years, I have been unable to find any caf√© which serves a cooked breakfast as good as my mum's breakfast. I have however finally found a place which makes me feel like I am at a home away from home thanks to their delicious breakfasts. This hidden gem near the bustling city financial district of Moorgate and London Liverpool Street Station, serves up the best full English breakfast I have ever eaten in a Caf√©. It reminds me of my mum's delicious breakfast at home and I urge anyone in London to go here, no matter where you are!
"
Nora Cafe,"Best little cafe in London! I love this little place. The food is always outstanding, the service is personal and charming, the vibe is mellow warm and classy, the prices are great value because the portions are generous and the flavours always add a bit...of interesting fabulousness to standard dishes. 

I always get the eggs benedict and mocha for breakfast, which comes with a bit of dark green salad, plum tomato, and other yummy stuff on the side, while the eggs are perfectly poached sitting on top of smoked bacon or ham, with hollandaise sauce and herbs. More flavourful and interesting than the same dish served anywhere else. 

At lunch, the Burger Blue is my favourite. Cheesy, great bun and fresh meat, side salad, sauces and fries/chips. Perfect! 

Try other fresh orange juice, made in the machine which slices the oranges to order. Or the smoothies, all delicious! 

The staff here are lovely. The music will calm your nerves and relax you on even your most stressful day. The decor is friendly, intimate, not pretentious just warm charming and personal. 

Nora's cafe has become my favourite, obviously.
"
Nora Cafe,"Being a coffee enthusiast or should I say ADDICT. I have stopped at many cafes either just on a walkabout or around my working locations (I am a temp, so i've been to lots of areas in London). I have to say Nora Cafe provides...the most superb service. Whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, the food is cooked to everyones taste and so delicious and not forgetting the mention of coffee, well it certainly gets my highest vote. I have heard other customers comments to the staff whilst dining and they all seem happy and content with a full stomach. I have recommended this diner to everyone I know whom have visited this area and they have been grateful. Thank you to the owner, Elif and other staff for providing the best standard of dining.

Nora Cafe,"Cafe Nora is excellent, what more can I say. 
We were staying at London City Travelodge and found cafe Nora the last time we visited London. We came here 3 mornings in a row for breakfast and it was excellent, sets you up for the...day ahead. It is always a good sign when the locals are eating somewhere and this had business people in suits as well as workmen eating here and staff from Greater Anglia railways too. I am Coeliac and they had gluten free bread but by day 2 they had been out and purchased gluten free sausages too. Thank you

Nora Cafe,"Stayed in whitechapel righg next to aldgate tube station for a couple of nights and ventured here for breakfast on the first morning..

WE WERE NOT LET DOWN!

Norahs is a nice little cafe on the backstreets,  and the first thing we noticed as we...walked in was someones huge omellette, 
That was that,  the wifes choice sorted cheese and mushroom omellette,  it comes with chips and salad but she asked to swap those for toast which they gladly did.,  i had the mega breakfast,  my sister had advocado on toast and her husband the traditional brekky.

The coffees were proper coffee and the orange juice squeezed in front of you.

All 4 of us cleared our plates and the prices were brilliant,  we are from derby and we would really struggle to get that breakfast at that price here.
 We dont normally go back to the same place twice but it started our day so well that we went again the following morning and once again, brilliant.

Staff all friendly,  location is clean and not a greasy spoon smell as you walk in either.

If back in that area we will deffo 100% be going again.

Many thanks

Nora Cafe,"We were staying at the local travelodge this weekend and wanted something for breakfast.  We stumbled on this amazing cafe and, despite the fact that there were 7 of us, space was made for us and we started to look at the menu.  What an...extensive menu there was!  Each of us had the most amazing breakfast - from those who wanted poached eggs and avocado, to those who wanted heavenly chocolate pancakes, to those who wanted the full works English breakfast.  It was so good, and so reasonable, that we returned on our second day for more - each ordering something different again!  We can't recommend them highly enough and will definitely return on our next visit into the big smoke.  Highly recommended.

Nora Cafe,"There‚Äôs nothing to beat a good old-fashioned Full English Breakfast. Here at Caf√© Nora (formerly Caf√© Thyme), there are nine fry-ups to choose from, ranging from ¬£6.95 to ¬£7.95, all cooked to order and served with tea or freshly ground coffee and toast or bread....The English Breakfast of two eggs, two rashers of bacon, sausage, hash browns, baked beans, mushroom, black pudding and grilled tomatoes is a firm favourite. There‚Äôs also a Mediterranean Set Breakfast and Vegan Brunch with vegan sausage and avocado. For the more adventurous, there is Eggs Benedict, omelettes, pastas, salads, pancakes, burgers, panini, jacket potatoes, sandwiches and filled baguettes. Something for everyone. Situated in East London‚Äôs popular Petticoat Lane Market, on Wentworth Street and near the corner of Middlesex Street, the caf√© is run by Turkish chef Ebru Puleri and her female Turkish friends. It‚Äôs a friendly, warm place, with comfortable seating, and popular with local workers, neighbours, market traders, students and visitors to London. It is walking distance from Aldgate East Tube and Liverpool Street Station. Open daily from early morning to 3pm.

Nora Cafe,"We were staying nearby last weekend and on reading the reviews thought we would give this cafe a visit. We had breakfast on Saturday morning -both ordering the English breakfast and then returned again on Sunday morning when I swapped to the English Potato hash....Both mornings we received excellent friendly service from our witnessed but Nora also made a point of coming out of the kitchen and chatting to us and making sure everything was ok. T
The food was freshly cooked, plentiful and so tasty with a great menu where anyone can get food to eat -there are Turkish and mediterranean choices, healthy, vegan and vegetarians options. On Saturday one table were requesting changes to their breakfast because they eat only halal meat and on Sunday a Jewish gentleman asked for his breakfast to be cooked in a particular way, nothing was too much trouble.
Absolutely no faults to be found. I even used the loo upstairs on Sunday and it was immaculately clean.
If we lived nearby it would become a local.

Bonoo Indian Tapas,"Cannot recommend Bonoo enough! Absolutely incredible food, a real experience from start to finish. The interior of the restaurant is really pretty, with warm lighting to create a relaxed atmosphere. The food is beautifully presented, and tasted delicious. The staff are exceptional, so attentive and...extremely passionate about the food/drinks they serve here. Che looked after us, he gave us recommendations and took time to explain how the food is cooked, and what goes into the amazing cocktails! Really wonderful experience, will definitely return on my next trip to London. Thank you Che, and staff at Bonoo, see you again! üôè
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"Came here for a Thursday evening for date night, I liked the interior although they sat us in the corner and with the screen between the tables I had a limited view of the restaurant. The waiters were fairly attentive, you look at the menu...through a qr code on your phone, they recommend 3/4 dishes per person.. we got 7 dishes between the two of us. We enjoyed all the dishes except one but that wasn‚Äôt down to the quality of the food which I thought was good. 
They offered us a complimentary drink at the end of the meal which was nice. Our 7 dishes & 1 Diet Coke came to ¬£71. Nice food but probably overpriced.
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"The food on the whole was quite good although overpriced for the quality and portion size. As we were‚Äùsuch nice customers‚Äù a complimentary drink was offered at the end then huge pressure to write a glowing review whilst we were at the table. Because of...this I‚Äôll never go or recommend this restaurant again.
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"Absolutely everything we ordered (and we ordered a lot) was perfect. Not one dish let the side down and we didn‚Äôt regret getting any of them. The set up is really romantic with candle light, cocktails and effortless/polite service. Didn‚Äôt feel rushed or hurried. The...waiter even wanted to make sure we didn‚Äôt end up spending too much‚Ä¶ but we couldn‚Äôt resist. Whoever reads this, enjoy!

Ps. I didn‚Äôt get any pictures of the beautiful bit I did of the complimentary Prosecco
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"From the warm welcome to the delicious and innovative food dishes, this restaurant cannot be faulted. We had several vegetarian tapas (as starters): mango salad, crispy avocado bites, Kashmiri asparagus and bhel. There are many vegan options too. Then for our larger plates we had...coconut fish curry (sea bass) and buttery chicken curry, both came with rice. Each dish is presented very nicely by staff who really care that their clientele should have a great meal. We were also offered a brandy or a Baileys on the house after our meal. If I tell you anymore you'll all want to go and I won't get a table when I next want to go!
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"The best restaurant in London. We have tried many Indian restaurants but this is by far the best we have been to, and honestly the best restaurant full stop. The food is simply incredible, the attention to detail on flavour and cooking is unreal. On...top of that, the service when sitting in is so refreshing - a team who genuinely care about your experience and go out of their way to make sure you have the best time possible. A rare find
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"Superb Indian place!! We saw that this place was #1 so we made the trek and it was so worth it. The food was absolutely incredible and the service was amazing. 

The restaurant is beautiful and cozy, the bathrooms are nice and smell great and...the overall atmosphere was favorable. 

Our server checked in on us throughout the meal and was incredibly thoughtful of our enjoyment. We were offered complimentary drinks at the end of the meal as well. They genuinely cared about our feedback and offered to fix anything that wasn‚Äôt to our liking (even though everything was)

I highly recommend the butter chicken - it melts in your mouth and is a good complement to other spicier dishes. 

I would absolutely come back here again when I‚Äôm back in London!
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"I turned up around 6pm on my own as I‚Äôm in the area through work.  I didn‚Äôt have a reservation and was advised that there was a table for around an hour.  

Let me tell you, the food it unbelievable and the service was outstanding....I won‚Äôt bore you with details of what I had, but I had around 5 dishes and took plent home with me.  The highway curry though was excellent.  In terms of the service the staff are outstanding.  Know when to check on you know when to leave you alone, perfect.  At one point a guy who I think was the owner appeared and we had a good chat about some of the Indian restaurants in Scotland we‚Äôd both been to.  Really nice guy and all the staff were great.  

One thing I really liked was that even though they mentioned I could only have a table for an hour due to bookings at no point did I feel rushed.  Really cannot fault the whole experience.
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"What a lovely place! Of all the dishes we tried, all but one was absolutely delicious and full of beautifully balanced flavour. The one I wasn‚Äôt keen on was the fried okra but only because I don‚Äôt tend to like deep fried food. My husband...enjoyed it. I would heartily recommend the chicken lollipops, the lamb curry and the aubergine. Really delicious. I just deducted one star as I found the prices a bit over the top - more central London prices where the overheads are higher.

The background Indian music was perfect - atmospheric and the right volume. 

Service was super friendly and our waiter readily gave some excellent recommendations.
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"Delicious food and fantastic service. I came here with my girlfriend for a Thursday night meal and was not disapointed. The waitress recommendee 4-5 dishes but the menu looked so great we ordered 8 and had some left over to take home. I would 100%...come back
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"The staff at Bonoo were amazing from the jump. We were greeted by the manager on arrival and made to feel very welcome. The food was outstanding, the service was 10/10. We were also offered complimentary mint tea after our dinner which was a lovely...touch. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious authentic Indian food with great service. We will definitely be returning.
"
Bonoo Indian Tapas,"The food at this restaurant is simply delicious, we visited with friends on Saturday evening and as someone who knows Indian food, I was very impressed with the variety on offer.  It's  tapas Indian which works so well as it means everyone can choose a...few dishes and share.
My favourite  is the spicy chicken called Highway Chicken, on the bone and deliciously spicy without being ridiculous, I urge you to try it.  As usual, we over-ordered but the staff were happy to provide take away containers - didn't want anything to go to waste particularly as it was so nice.
They have a range of Vegan dishes too (one of our party is Vegan) which were also very tasty.  The service was with a smile and at a pace that suited our relaxed evening out.
The restaurant have gone to huge lengths to make the establishment look wonderful, there are flowers (fake) on the walls and this provides a unique dining experience.
The restaurant had been made Covid safe with AntiBac everywhere and also plastic screens.
I highly recommend this restaurant and will certainly return on another occasion.

Bonoo Indian Tapas,"We had a great evening with old friends and Bonoo didn‚Äôt disappoint.

Devine Restaurant Coffee Bar,"We (me and my girlfriend) visited London in a nearby hotel for a week. On a recommendation from a friend, we had our breakfast at Devine. The service is definitely an attraction of its own, with a highly inviting atmosphere where every customer is treated...like they are special. We got recommendations on the menu, could mix-and-match items, and also got general advice and help for our London trip. Every day the owner remembered all the little details as well, which we appreciated for sure.

The food is a great value with about 10 pounds per person (including drinks) to keep you full until dinner. Besides the classic English breakfast, there is a large selection of paninis and special ingredients such as salmon, avocado or blue cheese. We especially liked the baked beans and scrambled eggs. Service was fast with no noticeable delays, even when the restaurant was busy.

When we visit London again we will be sure to return to Devine. Thank you very much for the great service.

We opted for the Full Monty breakfast and it was delicious, arrived so quickly and freshly cooked and I‚Äôm still full 8 hours later! Such great value for money, so if you are in this area, you need to check it out.

"
Devine Restaurant Coffee Bar,"Not only do the staff treat you like family from the moment you step in the door, but the deliciousness of the food matches the quality of service. My traveling companion and I enjoyed a piping-warm, hearty breakfast at an incredibly decent price.

There's a...genuine, home-cooked, hand-crafted quality to every dish. For example, the salmon carried an extra hint of ""smokiness"", giving it a pleasant flavor and texture somewhere between sashimi and grilled.

Located under the bridge, De Vine is a true hidden gem in London and well worth the visit for a classic, British breakfast, no matter what you're craving. (I'd certainly be a regular if I didn't live ""across the pond."")

Devine Restaurant Coffee Bar,"If you are looking for a hearty breakfast that is very fresh, this is your place. After traveling from the USA, it was great to have scrambled eggs, sausage, toast, and chips (french fries) all cooked to order.

Devine Restaurant Coffee Bar,"Outstanding, charming service in this local cafe with the widest variety of breakfast & lunch options. Their specials menu added even greater additions. We ate there 4 days out of our week in London, staying in a local Tower Hill hotel (the 5th day, we...slept in late & had to rush off to site-seeing). We loved their full English breakfast, variations on this, breakfast sandwiches, rolls if you're less hungry, homemade/house special hot sauce, & jacket potatoes. It was high quality food (& fast for takeaway as well) & surprisingly higher value. Agree with the other reviews that the customer service makes this the go to place for tourist (like us) & locals alike (we saw both).

Devine Restaurant Coffee Bar,"I first noticed de Vine cafe earlier this week when I was walking along Vine Street and logged it away to try later.  Today I called in, initially just for a coffee to fill time before lunch and to shelter from the rain. As I...walked in I was greeted like an old friend, asked what I wanted and shown to a table. My coffee was freshly made and served to me and I must say it was delicious, just how I like my coffee. As I sat there I noticed all customers being treated the same way, there is a genuine friendliness towards everyone. I was offered a second cup and happily accepted as I was enjoying the atmosphere.  Whilst I sat there I was aware of delicious food smells as people received their orders. Eventually, I decided to change my plans and stay on for lunch. Being both a vegetarian and having a gluten intolerance I was concerned that I may struggle. This was not to be, I was told that if I could not find anything on the menu then something could be made to order for me. I settled on an old favourite, cheese and mushroom omelette with half chips and half salad. The omelette was light and fluffy and cooked to perfection and I had a good balance of chips and salad. The cafe itself is spotless and, along with the aforementioned friendly atmosphere, not to mention the amazing value for money, I will certainly return the next time I am in London. 

This is a place not to be missed and certainly makes a change to the sterile coffee chains that abound in this area. It is really convenient for Tower Hill and Fenshurch Street. One not to be missed.
